# Nexus Drift Travel System

## Overview

The **Nexus** exists as a dimensional membrane that interpenetrates normal space-time, serving as the primary means of faster-than-light travel throughout the galaxy. Ships achieve FTL travel by **drifting** sideways through dimensional space into the Nexus, where vast distances are compressed into manageable transit corridors. This distinctive "sliding between the stars" aesthetic occurs when vessels shift their quantum state to match the Nexus dimension's frequency.

Unlike conventional space, the Nexus operates under altered physical constants. What requires decades of travel at light speed in realspace can be traversed in days or weeks through Nexus Drift. Time flows in a malleable relationship with causality within the Nexus, allowing ships to emerge at their destinations before light from their departure point would normally arrive in realspace.

**Visual Experience**: Ships appear to slide laterally across the field of stars for several perceived seconds before vanishing into the Nexus dimension. The Nexus itself appears as an endless twilight realm filled with shifting geometric patterns, aurora-like energy streams, and gravitational currents that experienced navigators learn to read like weather systems.

## Drift Engine Technology

### Standard Phase Resonance Systems

Commercial Drift engines operate by generating a **phase resonance field** that temporarily shifts a vessel's quantum state to match the Nexus dimension's frequency. This process requires massive amounts of precisely calibrated energy channeled through crystalline matrices.

**Core Components**:

**Quantum Crystal Matrix**
- Synthetic crystals grown in zero-gravity foundries
- Focus and amplify phase energy for dimensional shift
- Quality determines maximum safe transit distance
- Requires regular recalibration and maintenance

**Resonance Generators**

- Power requirements scale with ship mass
- Redundant systems required for safety
- Efficiency varies by technology era

**Phase Stabilizers**
- Maintain quantum coherence during transit
- Prevent spontaneous phase collapse
- Monitor dimensional stress on hull and systems
- Emergency shutdown protocols if instability detected

**Quantum Anchors**
- Emergency systems for forced realspace return
- Single-use devices causing significant strain
- Required by galactic maritime law
- 85% survival rate when properly maintained

### Navigation Systems

Standard navigation requires sophisticated computer systems calculating phase trajectories based on constantly shifting energy currents within the Nexus. Navigation computers maintain databases from millions of previous Drift transits, creating probability matrices ensuring 99.7% successful arrival within acceptable parameters.

**Navigation Process**:
1. **Phase Scanning**: Sensors map local Nexus currents and conditions
2. **Trajectory Calculation**: Computers plot optimal routes through energy streams
3. **Resonance Matching**: Ship's quantum frequency aligns with target coordinates
4. **Phase Translation**: Vessel shifts into Nexus dimension (sideways drift visual)
5. **Current Navigation**: Pilot follows calculated route through phase space
6. **Emergence**: Ship returns to realspace at destination coordinates

### Technology Era Scaling
