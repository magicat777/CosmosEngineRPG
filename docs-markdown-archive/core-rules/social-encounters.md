# Social Encounters

## Overview

Social encounters in Cosmos Engine use the same 2d10 resolution system as combat but focus on influence, deception, negotiation, and mass communication. These rules scale from intimate conversations to galactic political campaigns.

## Core Social Mechanics

### Social Resolution
**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment + Situation vs Target Number**

**Primary Combinations**:
- **Persuasion**: Presence + Social
- **Deception**: Presence + Social or Intellect + Social
- **Intimidation**: Presence + Intimidation or Might + Intimidation
- **Negotiation**: Presence + Negotiation or Intellect + Negotiation
- **Empathy**: Awareness + Social
- **Leadership**: Presence + Command

### Social Defense
Instead of physical defenses, targets use:
- **Mental Defense**: 10 + Resolve + (Intellect รท 2)
- **Social Standing**: May add reputation or status bonuses
- **Cultural Barriers**: +1 to +3 for different cultures/species

## SOCIAL ENCOUNTER STRUCTURE

### 1. Establish Stakes
Before rolling dice, establish:
- What does each party want?
- What are they willing to offer?
- What are the consequences of failure?
- Is violence an option?

### 2. Determine Approach
Players choose their social strategy:
- **Direct**: Honest persuasion (-0 modifier, builds trust)
- **Manipulative**: Deception/misdirection (-1 to +2 based on believability)
- **Aggressive**: Intimidation/threats (may escalate situation)
- **Analytical**: Logic and reason (works on some, not others)
- **Emotional**: Appeals to feelings (+1 with personal connection)

### 3. Social Initiative
**Initiative**: 2d10 + Awareness + Social
- Acts like combat initiative for complex negotiations
- Higher initiative controls conversation flow
- Can "interrupt" with Resolve check vs speaker's Presence

### 4. Social Actions
Each round represents a few minutes of conversation:

**Standard Actions**:
- **Make Argument**: Primary social attack
- **Read Person**: Awareness check to learn motivations
- **Change Tactics**: Switch approach without penalty
- **Call Support**: Bring in allies or evidence

**Move Actions**:
- **Positioning**: Improve circumstances (+1 next roll)

**Reactions**:
- **Counter-Argument**: Oppose their point immediately
- **Defensive Stance**: +2 Mental Defense until next turn

## INFLUENCE SYSTEM

### Influence Points (IP)
Complex social encounters use Influence Points to track progress:
- **Starting IP**: Based on NPC's Resolve + situation
- **Reduce to 0**: Achieve your primary goal
- **Hits**: Successful social "attacks" reduce IP
- **Critical Success**: Double IP reduction
- **Fumbles**: Lose IP yourself or escalate situation

### NPC Starting Influence

|------------|---------|----------|
| Friendly | 5-10 | Allies, fans, sympathizers |
| Neutral | 11-20 | Strangers, professionals |
| Suspicious | 21-30 | Rivals, cautious types |
| Hostile | 31-40 | Enemies, prejudiced |
| Impossible | 41+ | Sworn foes, fanatics |

### IP Damage
Success margin determines influence gained:
- **Bare Success (0-2)**: 1 IP
