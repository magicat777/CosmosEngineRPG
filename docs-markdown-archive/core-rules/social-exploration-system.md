# Social & Exploration System

**Complexity**: 2/10 (binary states + standard rolls)
**Depth**: Unlimited (through specialization trees)

## Core Mechanics

### Binary Relationship States
Each significant NPC/faction has a relationship track:
```
□ Unknown → □ Known → □ Trusted → □ Allied → □ Devoted
```

**Advancement**: Successful social rolls + appropriate actions
**No tracking**: Just check boxes on NPC/faction sheets

### Binary Discovery States
Each location/mystery has a discovery track:
```
□ Unexplored → □ Scouted → □ Mapped → □ Mastered → □ Exploited
```

**Advancement**: Successful exploration rolls + time invested
**Benefits**: Each state unlocks new options/resources

## Resolution Mechanics

### Social Encounters
```
2d10 + PRIMAC Attribute + Social Skill + Equipment + Situation vs TN
```
- **Success**: Advance relationship state OR gain specific favor
- **Critical Success**: Advance two states OR major concession
- **Failure**: No progress (relationship doesn't degrade unless dramatically appropriate)

### Exploration Challenges
```
2d10 + PRIMAC Attribute + Exploration Skill + Equipment + Situation vs TN
```
- **Success**: Advance discovery state OR find specific objective
- **Critical Success**: Advance two states OR exceptional find
- **Failure**: Danger/complication but state doesn't regress
