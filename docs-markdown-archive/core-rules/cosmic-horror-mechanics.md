# Cosmic Horror & Sanity Mechanics

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine supports cosmic horror campaigns where characters face incomprehensible threats, reality-breaking phenomena, and existential dread. These optional mechanics add psychological horror elements to any scale of play - from personal terror to galactic extinction events.

**Design Principles**:
- Knowledge is dangerous - understanding cosmic truths damages sanity
- Technology may betray - advanced systems can become corrupted
- Scale breeds horror - the vastness of threats creates existential dread
- Victory is survival - defeating cosmic entities is often impossible
- Corruption spreads - exposure to cosmic forces changes beings fundamentally

## Sanity System

### Core Mechanics

**Sanity Score** (0-100):
- Starting Sanity: 50 + (Resolve × 5) + (Intellect × 2)
- Maximum Sanity: 100 - (Cosmic Knowledge × 10)
- Current Sanity: Tracks mental stability and grip on reality

**Sanity Checks**:
```
2d10 + Resolve + Willpower vs Horror Rating
Success: No sanity loss or reduced loss
Failure: Lose sanity equal to margin of failure
Critical Failure: Additional effects (temporary madness, permanent quirks)
```

## Running Cosmic Horror

### GM Guidelines

**Building Dread**:
1. Start with subtle wrongness
2. Escalate incomprehensible events
3. Reveal cosmic scale gradually
4. Make victory pyrrhic
5. Show corruption's temptation

**Transformation**:
- Characters inevitably change
- Humanity becomes optional
- Power requires sacrifice
- Identity dissolves

**Futility**:
- Cosmic scale dwarfs heroes

## Design Notes

The Cosmic Horror mechanics transform Cosmos Engine campaigns into existential nightmare scenarios. By adding Sanity and Corruption as resources to manage alongside health and equipment, players face impossible choices between power and humanity. The system scales from personal body horror to galactic extinction, maintaining the core 2d10 resolution while adding layers of psychological terror.

Integration with existing systems ensures cosmic horror can overlay any campaign style - intimate crews discovering terrible truths, military forces fighting reality invasions, or entire civilizations facing extinction from incomprehensible forces.
