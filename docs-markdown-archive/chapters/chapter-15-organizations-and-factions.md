# Chapter 15: Organizations and Factions

> *"In space, nobody operates alone. You're either part of an organization, or you're prey for one that wants what you have."*
> 
> *—Captain Elena Martinez, veteran freelancer and author of "Surviving the Power Game"*

From street gangs to galactic empires, organizations shape the political landscape of science fiction. This chapter provides tools for creating, managing, and interacting with the groups that control resources, territory, and destinies across the cosmos.
