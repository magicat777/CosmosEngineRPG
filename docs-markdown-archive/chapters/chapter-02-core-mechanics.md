# Chapter 2: Core Mechanics

> *"The universe doesn't care about your plans, kid. But if you've got the right combination of skill, guts, and a little cosmic luck? Well, that's when miracles happen."*
> 
> *—Master Engineer Kai Okafor, explaining probability to her apprentice*

## Quick Start: The 2d10 System

**New Players: This is all you need to start playing!**

At the heart of Cosmos Engine lies a simple, unified resolution mechanic:

### The Universal Formula
**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Tag Bonuses vs Target Number (TN)**

When attempting something with uncertain outcome, the GM sets a Target Number based on difficulty. You roll two ten-sided dice, add your character's relevant capabilities and any tag bonuses, then compare the total to the TN. Meet or exceed it for success; fall short for failure.

**That's it. Everything else in this chapter explains how to make it amazing.**

### Reading the Cosmic Dice

**[INFOGRAPHIC: 2d10 Probability Bell Curve]**
*Visual showing: Peak at 11 (9% chance), declining to edges at 2 and 20 (1% each)*

When you roll 2d10, you add both dice for a result from 2 to 20. The probability curve clusters around 11, making routine tasks achievable for competent characters while preserving dramatic uncertainty for critical moments.

**Cosmic Resonance Events**:
- **Natural 20** (dual 10s): **Critical Success** - Reality bends to accommodate your action
- **Natural 2** (dual 1s): **Critical Failure** - Complications cascade beyond the immediate task  
- **Doubles** (matching numbers): **Extreme Results** - Amplified success or memorable failure

**Player Tip**: Critical results create story moments. A critical failure hacking a door might trigger security, while critical success could give you admin access to the entire facility.

## The PRIMAC Matrix

> *"Your body is your ship, your mind is your navigation system, and your spirit is your hyperdrive. Master all three, and you can reach any star."*
> 
> *—Void Monk teaching, translated from Ancient Luminos*

Every character possesses six primary attributes rated from 1 to 10, collectively known as **PRIMAC** *(PRY-mack)*:

**[INFOGRAPHIC: PRIMAC Wheel]**
*Visual showing six attributes arranged in a circle with connecting lines showing relationships*

### Presence (PRE) - Social Gravity
Your gravitational pull in social space—how reality bends around your personality. From inspiring loyalty in your crew to negotiating with alien ambassadors, Presence shapes how others perceive and respond to you.
- **Key Applications**: Command corporate boardrooms, rally troops before battle, negotiate cease-fires, perform for galactic audiences
- **Crisis Response**: Resist memetic weapons, maintain composure during interrogation, rally allies during despair

### Resolve (RES) - Mental Fortress  
Your consciousness's structural integrity when reality itself becomes hostile. The unshakeable core that maintains identity during mind-machine interface, resists cosmic horror, and perseveres when hope seems lost.
- **Key Applications**: Concentrate during ship combat, resist fear from eldritch entities, maintain sanity during time dilation, endure torture without breaking
- **Crisis Response**: Deflect psychic attacks, maintain personality during consciousness transfer, resist alien mental influence

### Intellect (INT) - Cognitive Engine
Your mind's computational capacity for analyzing, synthesizing, and extrapolating from incomplete data. From decoding alien languages to reverse-engineering hyperdrive technology, Intellect unlocks the universe's secrets.
- **Key Applications**: Hack AI security systems, perform emergency surgery, decode ancient star maps, outthink artificial intelligences
- **Crisis Response**: Penetrate holographic illusions, solve death-trap puzzles under pressure, recognize shapeshifter infiltrators

### Might (MIG) - Kinetic Authority

- **Key Applications**: Breach armored doors, survive high-g acceleration, wrestle aliens twice your size, throw plasma grenades accurately
- **Crisis Response**: Resist biological toxins, escape gravitational restraints, survive explosive decompression

### Awareness (AWA) - Perceptual Web
Your consciousness's interface with environmental data streams. From spotting cloaked ships to sensing the mood of alien crowds, Awareness connects you to the universe's subtle currents.
- **Key Applications**: Pilot through asteroid fields, detect hidden enemies, read alien body language, track prey across alien worlds
- **Crisis Response**: Notice ambush preparations, react to surprise attacks, detect reality distortions, sense environmental dangers

### Coordination (COO) - Precision Matrix
Your nervous system's capacity for executing complex motor sequences with surgical precision. From disarming quantum bombs to performing zero-g acrobatics, Coordination turns thought into flawless action.
- **Key Applications**: Pilot starfighters through debris fields, perform micro-surgery, disable security systems, dance at diplomatic galas
- **Crisis Response**: Dodge plasma blasts, maintain balance on shifting surfaces, execute emergency piloting maneuvers

### Attribute Scale

**1-3**: Below Average - Deficiency in this area
**4-5**: Average - Normal human capability
**6-7**: Above Average - Natural talent
**8-9**: Exceptional - Among the best
**10**: Legendary - Peak human ability

### Using Attributes

Attributes provide the foundation for all actions:
- **Attribute Only**: For raw, untrained efforts (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **With Skills**: Combined with training (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs TN)
- **Saving Throws**: Reactive defense (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **Contests**: Opposed rolls (highest total wins)

## Skills Overview

Skills represent specialized training and experience. Unlike attributes, skills start at 0 and improve through advancement points.

### Skill Progression (10 Ranks, 7 Tiers)
- **Rank 1**: Apprentice-I (Basic competency)
- **Rank 2**: Apprentice-II (Developing expertise)
- **Rank 3**: Journeyman-I (Professional level)
- **Ranks 4-5**: Journeyman-II (Exceptional ability)
- **Ranks 6-7**: Master-I (Sector-renowned)
- **Ranks 8-9**: Master-II (Legendary mastery)
- **Rank 10**: Grandmaster (Reality-defining)

Each skill rank grants one **tag** that describes how your abilities manifest, creating unique character differentiation and cross-skill synergies.

### Core Skills

**Combat** (Might or Coordination): Armed and unarmed fighting
**Pilot** (Awareness or Coordination): Vehicle and starship operation
**Tech** (Intellect): Computers, electronics, and engineering

## Tags and Synergies

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are narrative descriptors that define *how* your skills manifest in the world. They provide both mechanical benefits and rich storytelling opportunities:

- **Mechanical Bonuses**: +1 to +5 dice when circumstances match your tags
- **Character Differentiation**: Same skills, completely different characters through tags
- **Story Hooks**: Pre-built complications and spotlight moments for GMs
- **Cross-Skill Synergies**: Tags from different skills combine for emergent effects

### Tag Categories

**Style Tags** - How you approach tasks:
- [Precise]: Surgical accuracy, measured approach
- [Brutal]: Overwhelming force, intimidating presence
- [Subtle]: Hidden action, misdirection
- [Aggressive]: Forward momentum, taking initiative

**Source Tags** - Where abilities come from:
- [Enhanced]: Technological augmentation
- [Trained]: Dedicated learning and practice
- [Innate]: Natural talent or genetic gift
- [Experimental]: Untested methods or prototypes

**Domain Tags** - What your skills affect:
- [Digital]: Computer systems, networks, data
- [Social]: Interpersonal, cultural, emotional
- [Environmental]: Natural world, survival, adaptation
- [Mechanical]: Physical devices, engineering

### Tag Bonuses in Resolution

Tags modify dice rolls when circumstances align with your character's approach:

**Tag Bonus Formula**: +1 to +5 dice based on narrative fit
- **Perfect Match** (+3 dice): Circumstances ideal for your tag
- **Strong Match** (+2 dice): Tag clearly applies to situation
- **Partial Match** (+1 die): Tag tangentially relevant

**Example**: Marcus has Combat [Enhanced] from neural targeting implants
- In full daylight with clear sight lines: +3 dice (perfect conditions for targeting system)
- During normal combat: +2 dice (enhanced reflexes help)
- In EMP-affected area: +0 dice (implants non-functional)

### Synergy System

When tags from different skills work together, they create **synergies**:

**Perfect Synergy** (+3 dice):
- [Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect Moment" - Time seems to slow for ideal timing
- [Digital] + [Technical] = "Technomancy" - Technology bends to your will

**Strong Synergy** (+2 dice):
- [Enhanced] + [Trained] = "Optimized Performance" - Augmentation meets discipline
- [Social] + [Leadership] = "Natural Authority" - People instinctively follow

**Basic Synergy** (+1 die):
- Compatible tags that complement without conflict
- Minor coordination benefits

**Tag Conflicts** (-1 to -2 dice):
- [Brutal] vs [Subtle] = Must choose force or finesse
- [Reckless] vs [Patient] = Internal tension between approaches

### Tag Usage Guidelines

**Per Scene Limits**:
- **Perfect Synergies**: Once per scene free, then costs 1 Advancement Point
- **Strong/Basic Synergies**: Always available when applicable
- **Multiple Tags**: Maximum +5 dice total from all tag sources

**GM Discretion**: Tags require narrative justification - players must describe how tags apply to receive bonuses.

## Basic Task Resolution

### Setting Target Numbers

The GM sets Target Numbers based on task difficulty:

| Difficulty | TN | Example |
|------------|----|---------| 
| Trivial | 8 | Notice something obvious |
| Easy | 11 | Pick a simple lock |
| Moderate | 14 | Pilot through debris field |
| Hard | 17 | Hack military encryption |
| Extreme | 20 | Perform emergency surgery in zero-g |
| Legendary | 23 | Outsmart an AI |
| Impossible | 26 | Bend reality through will alone |

### Tag-Enhanced Resolution Process

1. **Player Declares Intent**: "I want to hack into the security system"
2. **GM Sets Difficulty**: "That's a Hard task, TN 17"
3. **Determine Attribute + Skill**: Intellect + Tech
4. **Apply Modifiers**: +2 for specialized tools
5. **Identify Applicable Tags**: Tech [Digital] + Stealth [Patient] = "Ghost Protocol" synergy
6. **Apply Tag Bonuses**: +3 dice for Perfect Synergy (invisible electronic infiltration)
7. **Roll Dice Pool**: 2d10 + 3 bonus dice = Roll 5 dice, use best 2
8. **Dice Results**: Best two dice: 8 and 7 = 15
9. **Calculate Total**: 15 + 6 (INT) + 4 (Tech) + 2 (tools) = 27
10. **Compare to TN**: 27 vs 17 = Success by 10 (Legendary Success!)

### Margins of Success and Failure

The difference between your result and the TN determines the degree of success or failure:

**Success Margins**:
- **0-2**: Marginal Success - You barely succeed
- **3-5**: Solid Success - Clear accomplishment  
- **6-9**: Critical Success - Exceptional result
- **10+**: Legendary Success - Perfect execution

**Failure Margins**:
- **1-2**: Marginal Failure - Almost succeeded
- **3-5**: Clear Failure - Definitely didn't work
- **6-9**: Critical Failure - Things go wrong
- **10+**: Catastrophic Failure - Disaster strikes

## Dice Pool Modifiers

### Tag Bonuses (Primary Modifier)
**Bonus Dice**: Add dice to your pool based on applicable tags:
- **Perfect Match**: +3 dice
- **Strong Match**: +2 dice  
- **Partial Match**: +1 die
- **Synergy Bonus**: +1 to +3 additional dice
