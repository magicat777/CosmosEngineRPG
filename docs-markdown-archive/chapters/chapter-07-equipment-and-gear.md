# Chapter 7: Equipment and Gear

Equipment in Cosmos Engine spans from primitive tools to reality-bending technology. More than just numbers and bonuses, every piece of equipment possesses **tags** that define its personality, capabilities, and how it interacts with character abilities. Your gear grows with you, developing new traits through use and becoming as unique as your character.

## 7.1 The Equipment Tag System

### Understanding Equipment Tags

Just as characters have skill tags that describe *how* they act, equipment has tags that describe *what* it enables and *how* it behaves. These tags:
- Create **synergies** with character tags (+1 to +5 dice)
- **Evolve** through use and story
- Define equipment **personality** and quirks
- Enable **emergent gameplay** through combinations

### Tag Categories for Equipment
