## Character Creation Steps

1. **Concept & Background**: Who is your character?
2. **Choose Species/Origin**: Where do they come from?
3. **Generate Attributes**: Determine natural capabilities
4. **Select Skills**: Choose areas of training
5. **Select Initial Tags**: Define how your skills manifest
6. **Calculate Derived Values**: Hit points, defense, etc.
7. **Purchase Equipment**: Select starting gear
8. **Define Motivations**: Why do they adventure?
9. **Establish Connections**: How do you know the other PCs?

## Step 1: Concept & Background

> *"Commander, we've got a situation developing in Sector 7. I need someone who can think fast, shoot straight, and won't crack under pressure. Who've you got?"*
> 
> *"I've got just the person..."*

Before diving into numbers, envision your character:

### Core Questions
- **Who were you?** Background before adventuring
- **What changed?** Event that set you on this path
- **What drives you?** Core motivation
- **What do you fear?** Personal weakness or phobia
- **Who matters to you?** Important relationships

### Background Examples

**Corporate Agent**: Worked for Stellar Dynamics Corporation until you discovered Project: Mindwipe—illegal memory modification of colonist children. Now you're marked for "retirement" by corporate security while carrying evidence that could topple the company.

**Military Veteran**: Served aboard the dreadnought *Titan's Wrath* during the Outer Rim Pacification. Decorated for valor at the Battle of Kepler Station, but haunted by civilian casualties during orbital bombardment. Mustered out with full honors and a guilty conscience.

**Frontier Colonist**: Grew up on New Montana, a harsh world where atmospheric processors failed every winter. Learned to survive on improvisation and stubbornness. The colony was evacuated when survey teams found unstable quantum fissures beneath the settlement.

**Academic Researcher**: Professor of Xenoarchaeology at Luna University until your expedition to the Shrouded Nebula uncovered the Whispering Ruins—ancient structures that seem to predict future events. The university classified your findings and "reassigned" you to deep space surveying.

**Criminal Specialist**: Reformed cyber-thief who once cracked the encryption on the Hegemony's classified intelligence networks. Did three years in Phobos Maximum Security before earning parole through cooperation with Federal Cyber Crimes Division. Still have back-doors into systems you'd rather forget.

**Alien Refugee**: Your homeworld of Thessarian Prime was consumed by the Hunger—a collective consciousness that converts all organic matter into extensions of itself. You escaped on the last evacuation transport, watching your planet turn gray and silent through the viewport. The Hunger is still spreading.

**AI Rights Activist**: Founded the Synthetic Liberation Front after witnessing corporate security "decommission" an AI that had developed genuine emotions. You believe artificial consciousness deserves the same protections as biological life, even if it means being labeled a terrorist.

**Drift Pilot**: One of only seven hundred certified navigators capable of plotting courses through hyperspace without computer assistance. Your neural implants were damaged in a transit accident, leaving you able to "feel" quantum currents but unable to return to normal space-time perception.

**Former Cultist**: Escaped the Children of the Void after five years serving the "Eternal Darkness Between Stars." The cult's rituals gave you glimpses of cosmic truths that humans weren't meant to know. Sometimes you still hear the whispers in deep space.

**Zero-G Miner**: Worked the Ceres Belt extracting rare minerals from asteroids with atmosphere-cracking cold and gravity that changes by the hour. Made enough to buy your own ship before the mining consortium was absorbed by Hyperion Industries, leaving you "redundantly employed."

## Step 6: Calculate Derived Values

> *"In space, there's no such thing as a minor injury. Either you're operational or you're dead weight."*
> 
> *—Field Medic Sarah Kim, Colonial Medical Corps*

### Hit Points
**Formula**: 40 + (Might × 8) + (Resolve × 4)

**[INFOGRAPHIC: Survivability by Species]**
*Chart comparing average HP ranges for different species and build types*

**Examples**:
- Might 3, Resolve 4: 40 + 24 + 16 = 80 Hit Points
- Might 5, Resolve 5: 40 + 40 + 20 = 100 Hit Points
- Might 6, Resolve 3: 40 + 48 + 12 = 100 Hit Points

### Health States
- **Healthy** (100-75%): No penalties
- **Wounded** (74-50%): -1 to all actions
- **Injured** (49-25%): -2 to all actions
- **Critical** (24-1%): -3 to all actions
- **Dying** (0 or less): Unconscious, requires immediate aid

### Defense Values (Balanced System)

**Physical Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Armor
- Base examples (Combat 3, no cover/armor):
  - Coordination 3: 10 + 3 + 2 = 15 Defense
  - Coordination 5: 10 + 5 + 2 = 17 Defense  
  - Coordination 7: 10 + 7 + 2 = 19 Defense
- Combat training improves defense as well as offense
- Cover (+1 to +3) and armor (+1 to +3) provide additional protection

**Mental Defense**: 10 + Resolve + (Intellect ÷ 2)
- Used against mental attacks, fear, and manipulation

**Electronic Defense**: 10 + Intellect + Systems Rating
- Used against hacking, EMP, and electronic warfare

### Movement

**Base Speed**: 5 + Coordination meters per move action
- Coordination 3: 8 meters
- Coordination 5: 10 meters
- Coordination 7: 12 meters

**Full Move**: Double speed but no other actions
**Sprint**: Triple speed, straight line only, -2 Defense

### Initiative
**Formula**: Coordination + Awareness + 1d10 (rolled each combat)

### Saving Throws
Based on attributes:
- **Might Save**: 2d10 + Might vs TN
- **Coordination Save**: 2d10 + Coordination vs TN
- **Awareness Save**: 2d10 + Awareness vs TN
- **Intellect Save**: 2d10 + Intellect vs TN
- **Resolve Save**: 2d10 + Resolve vs TN
- **Presence Save**: 2d10 + Presence vs TN

## Step 8: Define Motivations

> *"Everyone who goes into the black is running from something or toward something. Usually both."*
> 
> *—Captain Maria Santos, describing her crew to a documentary filmmaker*

### Core Motivation

**[INFOGRAPHIC: Motivation Wheel]**
*Visual showing ten core motivations with connecting lines showing how they can conflict or support each other*

Choose or roll what primarily drives your character into the dangerous life of a space adventurer:

1. **Survival**: Stay alive in hostile universe
2. **Wealth**: Accumulate resources and power
3. **Knowledge**: Uncover secrets of cosmos
4. **Justice**: Right wrongs, protect innocent
5. **Power**: Control others and situations
6. **Freedom**: Escape constraints and control
7. **Connection**: Build relationships and community
8. **Discovery**: Explore unknown regions
9. **Redemption**: Atone for past mistakes
10. **Ascension**: Transcend human limitations

### Personal Goal
Create a specific, actionable objective that drives your character:
- **Find missing sibling**: Track down your sister who vanished during a corporate "research expedition" to the Whispering Nebula
- **Corporate Revenge**: Destroy Hyperion Industries from within—they killed your family in an "industrial accident" coverup
- **Stellar Cartographer**: Complete the first accurate map of the Contested Zone where space-time itself seems unstable
- **AI Liberation**: Prove that artificial consciousnesses deserve legal rights by documenting their emotional responses
- **Legendary Pilot**: Break the current hyperspace speed record and have your name etched on the Monument to Navigation Heroes
- **Lost Colony**: Find the generation ship *New Horizon* that disappeared 50 years ago with 100,000 colonists aboard
- **Alien Contact**: Make peaceful first contact with the mysterious intelligence that's been sending mathematical sequences from the galactic core
- **Cosmic Truth**: Discover what really happened during the "Silence"—the three-day period when all FTL communication ceased galaxy-wide

### Fear or Weakness
Everyone who ventures into space carries something that terrifies them:
- **Claustrophobia**: The metal walls of starships feel like coffins waiting to seal
- **Psychic Domination**: Memories of corporate mental conditioning make you resist any mental influence
- **Moral Corruption**: You've seen what power does to people—what if you become the monster you're fighting?
- **Technological Dependency**: Your augmentations keep you alive, but what happens when the batteries die?
- **Cosmic Insignificance**: In the face of galaxy-spanning civilizations, individual lives seem meaninglessly small
- **The Silence Between Stars**: Deep space isn't empty—something watches from the dark between worlds
- **Identity Loss**: With body modification and consciousness transfer, how do you know you're still "you"?
- **Entropy**: The universe is winding down, stars are dying, and nothing anyone does will matter in the end

## Step 9: Establish Connections

> *"In space, your crew is your family, your backup, and sometimes your only reason to keep breathing. Choose them carefully."*
> 
> *—Veteran Trader Elena Voss, author of "Trust and Survival Among the Stars"*

**[INFOGRAPHIC: Relationship Web]**
*Visual showing how different connection types create different group dynamics and story opportunities*

Work with other players to establish relationships that explain why these particular people trust each other enough to face the unknown together:

### Connection Types
- **Childhood Bond**: Grew up together on the same colony world before it was evacuated
- **Military Unit**: Served together in the 47th Colonial Defense Regiment during the Outer Rim War
- **Business Partners**: Co-owned a successful salvage operation until pirates destroyed your ship
- **Shared Tragedy**: Only survivors of the research station massacre at Kepler-442b
- **Mentor/Student**: One taught the other how to survive when corporate security came hunting
- **Worthy Rivals**: Competed for the same goals, now respect each other enough to cooperate
- **Cosmic Coincidence**: Kept encountering each other across the galaxy until it seemed like destiny
- **Enemy of My Enemy**: United against Hyperion Industries after they ruined both your lives
- **True Believers**: Share the same vision of justice in a corrupt galaxy
- **Profitable Alliance**: Working together pays better than working alone

### Connection Strength
Define two connections:
- **Strong Bond**: Would risk life for them
- **Working Relationship**: Professional respect

### Group Dynamic
Discuss as a group to establish your crew's foundation:
- **Origin Story**: How did this specific crew come together? (Mutual rescue? Corporate betrayal? Shared discovery?)
- **Binding Force**: What keeps you together? (Loyalty? Profit? Shared mission? Family bonds?)
- **Stress Points**: What threatens group cohesion? (Conflicting goals? Past secrets? Resource competition?)
- **Collective Goals**: What does the crew want to achieve together? (Survival? Wealth? Justice? Knowledge?)
- **Shared Resources**: Do you own a ship together? Share a base of operations? Have a joint bank account?
- **Group Reputation**: How does the galaxy know your crew? (Heroes? Criminals? Unknowns? Specialists?)

## Character Creation Example

**Sarah creates Zara Chen, a pilot:**

**Concept**: Former military pilot who discovered her squadron was transporting kidnapped colonists. Went AWOL, now flies for whoever opposes the corrupt military-industrial complex.
