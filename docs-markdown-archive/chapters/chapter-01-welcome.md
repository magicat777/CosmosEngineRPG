## What is Cosmos Engine?

Cosmos Engine is a science fiction tabletop roleplaying game that scales seamlessly from intimate character-driven stories to galaxy-spanning conflicts. Using a unified 2d10 resolution system enhanced by the revolutionary **Universal Tag System**, players can explore any type of science fiction narrative - from the crew of a small trading vessel navigating political intrigue to massive fleets clashing in wars that determine the fate of civilizations.

### New to RPGs? Start Here!

**First Time Playing?** You need to know three things:
1. **Roll 2d10** + your character's relevant abilities
2. **Beat the difficulty number** the GM sets
3. **Tags** make your character unique and give bonus dice

*Everything else builds on these basics. Don't worry about the complex stuff yet!*

### Revolutionary Features

**[INFOGRAPHIC: 2d10 Bell Curve]**
*Visual showing probability distribution: 11 is most common result, 2 and 20 are rare*

**Unified Mechanics**: Every action, from bypassing a mag-sealed airlock to commanding a fleet, uses the same core 2d10 + Attribute + Skill system.

**Universal Tag System**: Characters develop unique approaches that grow more powerful through play. Your [Enhanced] cybernetics start as targeting assistance and evolve into reality-bending computational power.

**[INFOGRAPHIC: Scale Comparison]**
*Visual diagram showing relative sizes: Person → Hoverbike → Starfighter → Dreadnought → Fleet*

**Scalable Gameplay**: Four integrated scales of play:
- **Personal Scale**: Individual characters infiltrating corporate towers
- **Vehicle Scale**: Hoverbike chases through neon-lit cityscapes  
- **Starship Scale**: Spacecraft dogfights in asteroid fields
- **Fleet Scale**: Armadas clashing across star systems

**Genre Flexibility**: Run a personal-scale game like *Firefly*, add starships for *The Expanse*-style adventures, or include everything for epic *Star Wars*-scale campaigns.

**Hero Agency**: Characters remain meaningful at every scale. A single pilot can turn the tide of massive space battles through perfect timing, tactical brilliance, or desperate heroism.

## What is Roleplaying?

In a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG), you and your friends collaborate to tell an interactive story. One player takes the role of Game Master (GM), describing the universe and playing all the supporting characters. The other players each control a single protagonist - their player character (PC) - making decisions and rolling dice to determine outcomes.

Unlike a book or movie, no one knows exactly how the story will unfold. The GM presents situations, players decide how their characters respond, and dice determine success or failure. The result is a unique narrative that emerges from your collective creativity.

## The Science Fiction Sandbox

Cosmos Engine provides tools to explore any science fiction setting you can imagine:

**Hard Science Fiction**: Focus on realistic technology, physics constraints, and the challenges of space exploration. Every decision has weight, resources are limited, and the universe follows consistent rules.

**Space Opera**: Epic adventures with faster-than-light travel, alien civilizations, and galaxy-spanning conflicts. Heroes shape the fate of entire star systems through courage and determination.

**Cyberpunk**: Dive into dystopian futures where technology and humanity clash. Navigate corporate intrigue, hack reality itself, and decide what it means to be human in a digital age.

**Military SF**: Lead squads through desperate battles, command fleets in massive engagements, or wage guerrilla warfare against overwhelming odds. Strategy and tactics determine survival.

**Cosmic Horror**: Confront incomprehensible alien entities and existential threats. Knowledge comes at the cost of sanity, and victory often means merely surviving with your humanity intact.

**Post-Apocalyptic**: Explore the ruins of fallen civilizations, scavenge ancient technology, and rebuild in the shadow of a cosmic catastrophe. Every discovery could be salvation or doom.

## Example of Play

*Sarah (GM), Alex (playing Captain Chen), Brook (playing Dr. Vasquez), and Casey (playing Zara the pilot) are exploring a derelict space station.*

**Sarah (GM)**: The airlock cycles open with a pneumatic hiss, revealing a corridor lit only by emergency photoluminescent strips. The walls are covered in what looks like frost, but it pulses with an oily, bio-luminescent sheen. Environmental hazard tags: [Mysterious] [Contaminated]. What do you do?

**Alex (Captain Chen)**: I motion for the team to hold position while I sweep with my military-grade multi-spectrum analyzer. Any life signs or energy signatures? My [Military-Training] and [Enhanced] targeting implants should work well together here.

**Sarah**: Excellent synergy! Your [Military-Training] discipline combined with [Enhanced] implants creates "Tactical Scan Protocol" - that's +2 dice. Roll Awareness plus Technology with your synergy bonus.

**Alex**: *rolls 2d10 + 2 synergy dice* I got 8 and 7 on my main dice, plus my Awareness of 6 and Tech skill of 3... that's 24 total!

**Sarah**: Your military scanner initially glitches from the [Mysterious] environment, but your [Enhanced] implants compensate, stabilizing the readings. You detect minimal power in the station's core and... something large moving three sections ahead. The bio-signature doesn't match any known species in your implant's xenobiology database. Your scanner gains the [Alien-Touched] tag from this encounter.

**Brook (Dr. Vasquez)**: "Captain, that bio-luminescent matrix... I need a sample." I'm using my containment-field sampler - no direct contact. My [Scientific-Method] training and [Xenobiology] specialization should apply here.

**Casey (Zara)**: While doc works, I'm running threat assessment. This corridor screams ambush point - no cover, funnel design. My [Paranoid] pilot instincts are triggering hard.

**Sarah**: Perfect roleplay of your tags! Zara, your [Paranoid] nature gives you +1 die for threat recognition. Roll Awareness plus Survival with your paranoia bonus.

**Casey**: *rolls with bonus* 16 total.

**Sarah**: Your [Paranoid] assessment immediately identifies multiple tactical nightmares: zero cover, emergency lighting creating blind spots, and fresh bio-mechanical scoring marks on the ceiling - something with molecular-disruption claws was here recently. The corridor gains the [Predator-Territory] tag. Dr. Vasquez, your [Scientific-Method] and [Xenobiology] tags create "Field Research Protocol" (+2 dice). Roll Intellect plus Medical with your research synergy.

**Brook**: *rolls* That's... a critical failure. Two 1s.

**Sarah**: As you extend your sampling tool, the "frost" suddenly moves, flowing up the tool toward your hand like living mercury. Roll a Resolve save, TN 14, or drop the tool reflexively.

**Brook**: *rolls* 16! I maintain my grip.

**Sarah**: You hold steady as the substance reaches your gloved hand and stops, pulsing with a faint bioluminescent glow. Through your suit's haptic feedback, you feel it's surprisingly warm. Your suit's quarantine alarm begins chirping.

**Alex**: "Everyone back to the ship. Now. We're not equipped for this."

**Sarah**: As you start to retreat, the movement on your scanner suddenly shifts direction - heading toward you at increasing speed. The station's lights flicker and die. In the darkness, you hear a sound like breaking glass mixed with whale song. Roll for initiative...

*This example demonstrates:*
- *Core mechanics (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs Target Number)*
- *Tag synergies providing bonus dice ([Military-Training] + [Enhanced] = +2)*
- *Environmental tags affecting gameplay ([Mysterious], [Contaminated], [Predator-Territory])*
- *Equipment gaining personality through use (scanner becomes [Alien-Touched])*
- *How science fiction context replaces generic examples throughout Cosmos Engine*

## Your First Mission Brief

### Session Zero Protocol

Before launching your cosmic adventure:

1. **Establish Mission Parameters**: What kind of science fiction story excites your crew? Hard science exploration? Space opera heroics? Cyberpunk corporate intrigue? Use the safety tools in Chapter 11 to discuss boundaries for themes like:
   - Body horror and technological augmentation
   - AI consciousness and digital existence
   - Cosmic horror and existential threats
   - Violence levels and character mortality

2. **Forge Your Crew**: Work through Chapter 3 together, building both individual heroes and team connections. Why do these specific people trust each other enough to face the unknown together?

3. **Start Personal, Scale Up**: Begin with character-focused adventures in space stations, colonies, or starships. The Universal Tag System ensures personal moments become the foundation for epic legends.

4. **Learn Through Discovery**: Master the basics (2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Tag bonuses vs Target Number) first. Advanced systems like fleet combat and cosmic horror can wait until your characters are ready.

5. **Embrace Emergent Evolution**: Science fiction thrives on discovery and transformation. Let your characters' tags evolve naturally through play, creating unique stories that belong to your table.

### Player Tip: Document the Journey
Keep notes about how your tags develop and equipment gains personality. These details become the foundation of your campaign's unique mythology.
