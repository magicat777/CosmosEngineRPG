# Chapter 16: Advanced Options

Beyond the core rules lie systems for groups seeking deeper customization and specialized gameplay. With the Universal Tag System, these advanced options integrate seamlessly through tag evolution, creating unique character paths that transcend normal limitations while maintaining mechanical clarity. This chapter presents enhanced frameworks for cybernetic evolution, psionic mastery, AI consciousness development, cosmic horror integration, and other concepts that transform campaigns.

## Using Advanced Options

### Tag-Based Integration Guidelines

Advanced options utilize the Universal Tag System to create specialized character paths without mechanical complexity. Each system introduces new tag categories that evolve through use:

**Tag Integration Principles**:
- **Compatible Evolution**: Advanced tags build on foundation tags
- **Narrative Focus**: Tags drive story development, not complex subsystems
- **Synergy Opportunities**: Advanced tags create unique combinations
- **Scale Progression**: Tags evolve meaning across Personal to Cosmic scales
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Player choices and tag evolution determine outcomes

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Foundation**: Start with basic tags, evolve through play
- **Discovery**: Allow players to experiment with new tag types
- **Integration**: Weave advanced options into existing character concepts
- **Evolution**: Let tags transcend their original limitations

**Complexity Management**:
- All options use standard tag mechanics (+1 to +5 dice bonuses)
- No additional subsystems or tracking required
- GM guidance focuses on narrative interpretation
- Players drive development through tag selection and use
