# Chapter 13: Campaign Building

> *"Every legend starts with a single choice. Every campaign starts with a single session. But the greatest stories? They span generations, transcend scales, and reshape reality itself."*
> 
> *—Campaign Architect Yuki Tanaka, designer of the legendary "Starfall Chronicles" campaign*

Great campaigns evolve from humble beginnings into epic stories that span worlds and generations. This chapter provides frameworks for creating campaigns that grow with characters from street-level adventures to cosmic legends, maintaining narrative coherence and mechanical balance throughout.

## Campaign Planning Framework

> *"Captain's Log, Day 1,247: When we started this mission, we were just smugglers trying to make ends meet. Now we're negotiating the fate of three star systems. Funny how perspective changes when you're not just fighting for your next meal."*
> 
> *—Final entry from Captain Chen's personal log, found aboard the derelict "Lucky Strike"*

## Campaign Planning Framework

### Campaign Scales

**[INFOGRAPHIC: Campaign Scale Progression]**
*Visual showing how character capabilities and story scope expand from personal to cosmic levels*

**Street-Level Heroes** (Levels 1-8): *"Scrapers and Survivors"*
- **Focus**: Personal stakes and local threats—keeping the lights on and staying alive
- **Technology**: Standard equipment one era below galactic norm (often salvaged or jury-rigged)
- **Scope**: Single colony, orbital station, asteroid belt, or planetary region
- **Threats**: Corporate security forces, criminal syndicates, equipment failures, hostile environments
- **Progression**: Building reputation from "unknown nobodies" to "those competent troubleshooters"
- **Example**: Crew of the freight hauler *Lucky Break* taking odd jobs around the Ceres Belt mining colonies

**Galactic Operatives** (Levels 5-15): *"Sector Shakers"*

## Technology Era Campaigns

> *"Every era has its heroes. The tools change, but courage, desperation, and the will to survive? Those are constants across all of space and time."*
> 
> *—Historian Dr. Elena Vasquez, "Chronicles of Galactic Civilization"*

### Primitive Era Campaigns: *"Swords and Starships"*
- Survival and resource scarcity dominate every decision—water, food, shelter, and basic tools
- Technology advancement represents quantum leaps in capability—discovering gunpowder or steam power
- Simple tribal or feudal social structures with clear hierarchies
- Limited scope but intensely personal stakes—save the village, protect the family
- **Equipment Context**: Characters use [Simple] melee weapons, [Natural] armor, and scavenged materials with maximum 1 tag
- **Tech Progression**: Finding a working pistol or energy cell becomes a campaign-defining event
- **Example**: Colonists on a lost world reverting to medieval society while ancient starship wreckage provides mysterious artifacts
- **Signature Gear**: Swords, bows, leather armor alongside salvaged energy weapons they can't maintain

### Industrial Era Campaigns: *"Steam and Steel Among the Stars"*
- Social upheaval as traditional structures crumble under mechanization
- Rapid technological change creates both opportunity and displacement
- Environmental degradation from uncontrolled industrial growth
- Colonial expansion driven by resource needs and population pressure
- **Equipment Context**: Characters use [Kinetic] firearms, [Hardened] metal armor, and steam-powered machinery with maximum 2 tags
- **Tech Progression**: Introduction of electricity and radio communications changes everything
- **Example**: Asteroid miners using steam-powered equipment while corporate overlords exploit both workers and alien ecosystems
- **Signature Gear**: Revolvers, rifles, steel plate armor, mechanical tools, early spacecraft with chemical rockets

### Advanced Era Campaigns: *"Digital Dreams and Corporate Nightmares"*
- Information warfare where data theft matters more than physical violence
- Corporate mega-entities controlling governments and personal lives
- Cybernetic enhancement blurring the line between human and machine
- First tentative steps into space revealing both wonders and horrors

- **Example**: Reality architects defending the universe against entities that exist outside the concept of existence itself
- **Signature Gear**: Void cannons, reality anchor suits, probability guns, sentient starships, dimensional gates, universe-editing tools

## Scaling Challenges

### Personal to Planetary

**Scope Expansion**:
- Individual problems become regional
- Local threats affect entire worlds
- Personal enemies gain larger resources
- Stakes escalate naturally

**Mechanical Changes with Sci-Fi Examples**:
- **Larger Scale Equipment Access**: Personal plasma rifles become point-defense turrets on mining corvettes
- **Technology Integration**: [Enhanced] cybernetic implants synergize with [Advanced] starship AI networks for perfect targeting
- **Cross-Scale Effectiveness**: Stellar Era particle beam pistols can disable Industrial Era cargo haulers with precise shots to engine manifolds
- **Economic Scale Adjustment**: A single Cosmic Era reality-anchor costs more than terraforming an entire star system

### Planetary to Galactic

**Political Integration**:
- Local politics become interstellar
- Trade routes and alliances crucial
- Species and cultural conflicts
- Ancient mysteries and artifacts

**Resource Scaling with Sci-Fi Examples**:
- **Planetary Resources Accessible**: Control of rare-mineral worlds allows purchasing [Legendary] consciousness-transfer technology
- **Fleet Command Possibilities**: Personal [Command] tags coordinate hundred-ship exploration fleets through uncharted nebulae
- **Megacorporation Involvement**: Hyperion Industries provides experimental quantum-phase weapons and prototype reality-editing systems
- **Government Backing**: Colonial Defense Force supplies military-grade powered armor and AI-assisted tactical networks

### Galactic to Cosmic

**Reality Alteration with Sci-Fi Examples**:
- **Physics Manipulation Available**: [Reality-Bending] void cannons reshape matter at the molecular level during combat
- **Dimensional Travel Possible**: Characters use [Quantum] phase suits to step through parallel realities during infiltration missions
- **Consciousness Transfer Routine**: Equipment stores character personalities in quantum matrices, allowing resurrection after death
- **Time Manipulation Limited**: [Temporal] artifacts can slow time locally but risk attracting entities that police causality violations

**Existential Stakes**:
- Threats to reality itself
- Ancient cosmic entities
- Universal law conflicts
- Transcendence opportunities
