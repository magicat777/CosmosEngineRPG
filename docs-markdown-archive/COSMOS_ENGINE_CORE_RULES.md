# Introduction

Cosmos Engine is a science fiction tabletop RPG that lets you play heroes across the galaxy, from street-level investigators to reality-shaping legends. The game uses a unified 2d10 system that scales seamlessly from personal action to galactic-scale operations.

## What You Need to Play

- 2-6 players (including one Game Master)
- One complete polyhedral dice set per player (d4, d6, d8, 2d10, d12, d20)
  - 2d10 for all skill checks and core mechanics
  - Other dice for damage rolls and special effects
- Character sheets
- Paper and pencils

## Design Principles

**Universal Resolution**: One 2d10 system handles all actions across all scales.

**Meaningful Choices**: Every decision should present interesting tradeoffs.

**Scalable Adventure**: Start as local heroes, become galactic legends.

**Technology Progression**: Advancement unlocks new capabilities, not just bigger numbers.

**Streamlined Complexity**: Depth without overwhelming detail.

---

# Core Mechanics

## Universal Resolution System

Everything in Cosmos Engine uses the same core mechanic:

**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment + Situation vs Target Number**

### Core Components

- **2d10**: Roll two ten-sided dice and add results (2-20 range)
- **Attribute**: One of six PRIMAC attributes (1-10 range, balanced scaling)
- **Skill**: Relevant skill rating (0-5 range)
- **Equipment**: Technology bonus (0-6 by era)
- **Situation**: Consolidated modifier (-3 to +3)

### Target Numbers

| Difficulty | TN | Description |
|------------|----|-----------  |
| **Trivial** | 6 | Almost impossible to fail |
| **Easy** | 8 | Routine task under pressure |
| **Moderate** | 11 | Standard difficulty |
| **Hard** | 14 | Requires expertise |
| **Extreme** | 17 | Pushes human limits |
| **Legendary** | 20+ | Beyond normal possibility |

### Critical Results

**Natural 20** (rolled exactly 20 on 2d10):
- Always succeeds regardless of difficulty
- Attacker chooses bonus effect in combat
- Exceptional success in non-combat

**Natural 2** (rolled exactly 2 on 2d10):
- Always fails regardless of bonuses
- Equipment degradation check required
- Dramatic complication

### The Dice Curve

2d10 creates a probability curve that rewards competent characters:
- Average roll: 11
- 75% chance of rolling 8+
- 25% chance of rolling 15+
- Natural results (2, 20) occur 1% of the time

This means skilled characters succeed reliably at appropriate tasks while maintaining tension for challenging situations.

# Combat System

The Cosmos Engine combat system uses the universal 2d10 resolution mechanic to create tactical, fast-paced encounters across all scales of play.

## Combat Overview

### Balanced Combat Formulas

**Attack Resolution** (vs Defense, not Target Number):
```
2d10 + Attribute + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Equipment + Situation vs Defense
```

**Defense Calculation** (replaces static Target Numbers):
```
10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Equipment
```

**Damage Resolution**:
```
Weapon Base + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Success Margin + Enhancements
```

**Core Changes from Previous Versions**:
- **Skill Scaling**: Combat skill divided by 2 prevents excessive bonuses at high levels
- **Defense Active**: Defense now includes Combat skill, making training valuable for both offense and defense
- **Consistent 85% Hit Rate**: Attack vs Defense maintains ~85% success rate against same-level opponents
- **Level Gap Rules**: Special mechanics for 5+ level differences (see Balance Rules)

**Component Details**:
- **Attribute**: Coordination (ranged), Might (melee), or other as appropriate
- **Combat Skill**: 1-10 scale, but divided by 2 for attack/damage bonuses
- **Equipment**: Weapon/armor rating (+0 to +3 by technology era, balanced scaling)
- **Situation**: Consolidated modifier (-3 to +3) covering range, cover, environment

## Initiative & Turn Order

### Initiative System (Balanced)
**Initiative**: 1d10 + Coordination + Awareness

*Note: Changed from 2d10 to 1d10 to reduce initiative inflation at high levels*

**Process**:
1. All participants roll initiative at start of encounter
2. Act in descending order (highest to lowest)
3. Keep same order throughout entire encounter
4. On ties, PCs act before NPCs, then by highest Coordination

### Combat Round Structure

#### Phase 1: Initiative (First Round Only)
- Roll 1d10 + Coordination + Awareness
- Establish turn order for entire encounter

#### Phase 2: Declare Actions
- Players announce general intentions
- No need for detailed mechanics yet
- Can change specifics when turn arrives

#### Phase 3: Action Resolution
- Act in initiative order
- Resolve each character's full turn completely
- Apply damage and effects immediately

#### Phase 4: End of Round
- Apply ongoing effects (burning, bleeding, etc.)
- Advance status effect timers
- Check equipment degradation if triggered

## Action Economy

Each character gets one action of each type per turn:

### Standard Action (Choose One)
- **Attack**: Make weapon attack or combat maneuver
- **Complex Skill Use**: Hacking, detailed medical treatment
- **Electronic Warfare**: Jam systems, hack networks
- **Special Maneuvers**: Suppressive fire, coordinated attacks

### Move Action (Choose One)
- **Movement**: Change position, range bands
- **Power Reallocation**: Adjust enhancement settings
- **Simple Skill Use**: Basic technical tasks, quick checks
- **Combat Movement**: Evasive maneuvers, positioning

### Quick Actions (Any Number)
- **Reload**: Change magazines, power cells
- **Activate Equipment**: Turn on devices, systems
- **Simple Communication**: Short phrases, hand signals
- **Draw/Sheathe**: Ready weapons or equipment

### Free Actions (Any Number)
- **Drop Items**: Release held objects
- **Speak**: Brief sentences, warnings
- **Toggle Controls**: Simple switches, obvious controls
- **Look Around**: General awareness of situation

### Reactions (Limited by Technology)
- **Defensive**: Dodge incoming attacks
- **Opportunistic**: Attack exposed enemies
- **Protective**: Shield allies from harm
- **Counter**: Respond to enemy actions

## Range & Positioning

### Universal Range Bands

Distance is abstracted into range bands that scale by operational level:

| Scale | Close | Short | Medium | Long | Extreme |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|---------| 
| **Personal** | 0-2m | 3-10m | 11-50m | 51-250m | 251m+ |
| **Vehicle** | 0-50m | 51-500m | 0.5-5km | 5-25km | 25km+ |
| **Starship** | 0-1km | 1-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000km+ |
| **Capital** | 0-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000-10000km | 10000km+ |

### Range Modifiers
Applied to attack rolls:
- **Close**: +2 (melee range, point-blank shooting)
- **Short**: +1 (optimal range for most weapons)
- **Medium**: +0 (standard engagement distance)
- **Long**: -1 (requires good aim and weapons)
- **Extreme**: -2 (specialist equipment needed)

## Cover & Concealment

### Cover System
Physical protection that increases Defense:

#### Light Cover (+1 Defense)
- **Examples**: Corner of wall, vehicle door, debris
- **Protection**: Partial body coverage
- **Weakness**: Vulnerable to flanking, area effects

#### Heavy Cover (+2 Defense)
- **Examples**: Solid wall, vehicle hull, reinforced position
- **Protection**: Most of body covered
- **Requirement**: Must be deliberately using cover

#### Superior Cover (+3 Defense)
- **Examples**: Bunker, turret, prepared fortification
- **Protection**: Nearly complete protection
- **Special**: Attackers need Awareness check (TN 12) to target

#### Total Cover (Cannot be targeted)
- **Examples**: Around corner, behind solid barrier
- **Protection**: Complete line-of-sight blockage
- **Limitation**: Cannot attack while in total cover

### Concealment System
Reduces attacker's ability to target accurately:

#### Light Concealment (-1 to enemy attacks)
- **Examples**: Dim lighting, light smoke, rain
- **Effect**: Harder to aim precisely
- **Duration**: Usually environmental

#### Heavy Concealment (-2 to enemy attacks)
- **Examples**: Heavy smoke, darkness, dense fog
- **Effect**: Difficult to distinguish targets
- **Tactics**: Often created by equipment or grenades

#### Total Concealment (Cannot target visually)
- **Examples**: Complete darkness, opaque barriers
- **Effect**: Must use other senses or area attacks
- **Technology**: Thermal/EM sensors can overcome

## Attack Resolution

### Basic Attack Sequence
1. **Declare Target**: Choose enemy and weapon/attack type
2. **Check Range**: Confirm weapon can reach target
3. **Calculate Modifiers**: Range, cover, concealment, situation
4. **Roll Attack**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment + Situation
5. **Compare to Defense**: Target's Defense TN
6. **Apply Results**: Damage, status effects, critical effects

### Attack Types

#### Ranged Attacks
- **Attribute**: Coordination + Combat skill
- **Range**: Depends on weapon type
- **Ammunition**: May require Quick Action to reload

#### Melee Attacks
- **Attribute**: Might + Combat skill
- **Range**: Must be at Close range
- **Benefit**: Cannot be disarmed by EM weapons

#### Area Effect Attacks
- **Target**: Area rather than individual
- **Effect**: All characters in area roll defense
- **Cover**: Provides normal benefits
- **Examples**: Grenades, flamethrowers, energy weapons

### Critical Hits
**Natural 20** triggers critical effects. Attacker chooses ONE:

#### Double Damage
- Roll weapon damage twice and add together
- Most reliable choice for eliminating threats

#### Status Effect
- Inflict appropriate condition based on damage type
- **Kinetic**: Bleeding, knockdown, physical impaired
- **Energy**: Burning, system overload, mental impaired
- **EM**: System disabled, electronic interference
- **Exotic**: Varies by source

#### Penetrating Hit
- Ignore target's armor rating completely
- Effective against heavily armored opponents
- Represents hitting weak spots or system vulnerabilities

#### Tactical Advantage
- Grant ally bonus action immediately
- Force enemy to move one range band
- Disrupt enemy formation or plans
- Create battlefield opportunities

# Health & Damage

The Cosmos Engine uses a streamlined health system that balances tactical depth with easy tracking. Characters track a single Hit Point pool with meaningful thresholds.

## Personal Scale Health

### Hit Points
**Calculation**: 10 + (Might × 2) + Resolve

**Starting Range**: 10-30 HP (average character has 16-20 HP)

Hit Points represent a combination of physical durability, combat training, luck, and the ability to minimize serious harm.

### Health Thresholds
Characters exist in one of four health states:

#### Healthy (100-75% HP)
- No penalties or visible effects
- Character operates at peak performance
- Minor scrapes and bruises only

#### Wounded (74-25% HP)
- Visible injuries (bleeding, burns, fractures)
- No mechanical penalties (heroic resilience)
- Other characters can see you're hurt
- **Narrative Impact**: Description should reflect injuries

#### Critical (24-1% HP)
- Severe trauma threatening consciousness
- **-2 penalty** to all actions
- Must make **Resolve check (TN 11)** for strenuous activities
- **Strenuous Activities**: Sprinting, climbing, lifting heavy objects

#### Defeated (0 HP)
- Character is down and out of the fight
- **Player Choice** (based on campaign tone):
  - **Heroic**: Unconscious but stable
  - **Gritty**: Dying (see Death & Dying rules)
  - **Cinematic**: Dramatically injured but conscious

## Damage Application

### Standard Damage
Most attacks deal standard damage that reduces Hit Points directly.

**Damage Calculation**: Weapon Base + Success Margin + Modifiers
- **Base Damage**: Varies by weapon (typically 1d10 for personal scale)
- **Success Margin**: Extra damage for beating defense by 5+
- **Modifiers**: Technology enhancements, special ammunition, etc.

### Damage Types & Defenses

| Damage Type | Effective Defense | Weak Against | Special Effects |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Kinetic** | Physical Armor | Energy Shields | Knockback, bleeding |
| **Energy** | Reflective Armor | Electronics | Burns, overheating |
| **Electromagnetic** | Shielding | All Electronics | System disruption |
| **Exotic** | None | Everything | Varies by source |

## Status Effects

Status effects use three categories with three severity levels:

### Physical Status
**Impaired** (-2 to physical actions): Minor injuries, fatigue
**Disabled** (Cannot take physical actions): Serious injury, restraints
**Critical** (Ongoing crisis): Bleeding, burning, organ failure

### Mental Status
**Impaired** (-2 to mental actions): Confusion, minor stress
**Disabled** (Cannot think clearly): Stunned, overwhelmed
**Critical** (Mental breakdown): Panic, berserk rage, catatonic

### System Status
**Impaired** (-2 to electronic actions): Minor interference
**Disabled** (Systems offline): Hacked, power loss, EMP
**Critical** (Cascade failure): Progressive system failure

**Stacking Rules**: Different categories stack, same categories don't

## Recovery & Healing

### Natural Recovery
**Rest**: Characters recover differently based on activity level:
- **Light Activity**: 1 HP per day
- **Full Rest**: 2 HP per day
- **Medical Supervision**: 3 HP per day

### Medical Treatment
Medicine skill checks provide immediate healing:

#### Field Medicine (TN 11)
- **Time**: 1 minute
- **Effect**: Stabilize dying character + restore 1d10 HP
- **Limit**: Once per character per scene
- **Equipment**: Basic medical supplies

#### Medical Treatment (TN 14)
- **Time**: 10 minutes
- **Effect**: Restore 2d10 HP + remove one status effect
- **Limit**: Once per character per day
- **Equipment**: Medical kit or facility

#### Surgery (TN 17)
- **Time**: 1 hour
- **Effect**: Remove Critical threshold penalty + restore character to 50% HP
- **Limit**: Requires proper medical facility
- **Risk**: Failure causes 1d10 damage

## Vehicle & Larger Scale Health

### Condition Tracks
Vehicles and larger entities use the 5-box condition track:

**Operational** → **Damaged** → **Impaired** → **Critical** → **Destroyed**

#### Condition Effects
- **Operational**: No penalties
- **Damaged**: -1 to all actions
- **Impaired**: -2 to all actions, some systems offline
- **Critical**: -3 to all actions, major systems failing
- **Destroyed**: Inoperable (crew may survive)
