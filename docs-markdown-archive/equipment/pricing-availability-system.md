# Equipment Pricing & Availability System

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine pricing system provides economic structure for all equipment while maintaining game balance and narrative flexibility. Prices scale with technology eras and account for manufacturing complexity, rarity, legal restrictions, and market forces. The system emphasizes meaningful economic choices over detailed bookkeeping.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Economic choices should enhance rather than constrain gameplay
- Technology advancement comes with exponential cost increases
- Availability matters more than absolute pricing
- Market forces create realistic economic pressures
- Player wealth should enable character concepts, not limit creativity

**Core Principles**: Exponential cost scaling, Meaningful tradeoffs, Availability tiers, Market dynamics, Era-appropriate economics
