# Tag System Integration with 7×15 Skill Structure

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine tag system provides **narrative depth** and **cross-skill synergies** without adding mechanical complexity. Each skill in our 7×15 structure grants tags that describe **how** abilities manifest, creating rich character differentiation and GM story hooks.

---

## **Tag Assignment Structure**

### **Base Skills (Rank 1)**
Every base skill grants **1 foundational tag** that describes your basic approach:

**Examples:**
- Combat → [Trained], [Enhanced], [Instinctive], or [Brutal]
- Pilot → [Technical], [Intuitive], [Reckless], or [Precise]  
- Tech → [Digital], [Mechanical], [Creative], or [Systematic]

### **Progression Skills (Ranks 2-10)**
Each advancement grants **1 additional tag** that adds nuance:

**Tag Categories:**
- **Style Tags**: HOW you use the ability ([Subtle], [Brutal], [Precise], [Creative])
- **Source Tags**: WHERE it comes from ([Enhanced], [Trained], [Innate], [Experimental])
- **Domain Tags**: WHAT it affects ([Digital], [Social], [Environmental], [Mechanical])
- **Limitation Tags**: WHEN it fails ([Tech-Dependent], [Emotional], [Resource])

---

## **Tag Synergy Mechanics**

### **Cross-Skill Tag Bonuses**
When using skills with **complementary tags**, gain advantages:

**Style Synergies:**
- [Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect moment" (+2 when both apply)
- [Brutal] + [Aggressive] = "Overwhelming force" (ignore 1 point of resistance)
- [Subtle] + [Digital] = "Ghost protocol" (invisible to sensors)

**Domain Synergies:**
- [Social] + [Digital] = "Information warfare" (manipulate through data)
- [Environmental] + [Mechanical] = "Field engineering" (adapt tech to conditions)
- [Leadership] + [Technical] = "Expert coordination" (team technical actions)

### **Tag Limitations**
Certain tag combinations create **complications**:
- [Reckless] + [Patient] = Internal conflict (-1 when both would apply)
- [Digital] + [Environmental] = System conflicts in harsh conditions
- [Brutal] + [Subtle] = Contradictory approaches require choice

## **Character Creation Integration**

### **Step 1: Choose Base Skills**
Select which of the 15 skills you want, each grants a foundational tag.

### **Step 2: Define Tag Manifestations**
For each tag, document:
- **Source**: How you gained this approach
- **Manifestation**: How it appears in the world
- **Weakness**: When it doesn't work
- **Personality**: How it affects your behavior

### **Example Documentation:**
```
CHARACTER: Marcus "Wire" Chen
COMBAT [Enhanced]: Neural combat implant
TECH [Digital]: Consciousness partially uploaded
PILOT [Reckless]: Adrenaline junkie with death wish

TAG MANIFESTATIONS:
[Enhanced]: "Dragon Protocol" - HUD shows threat assessments
  Source: Military cyborg program
  Visual: Red targeting overlays, tactical data streams  
  Weakness: EMP, hacking, power drain
  Personality: Sees everything as tactical problem

[Digital]: "Ghost in the Shell" - Part of mind lives in networks
  Source: Experimental consciousness transfer
  Visual: Eyes glow when accessing networks
  Weakness: Network dead zones, AI detection systems
  Personality: Sometimes speaks as "we", talks to AIs

[Reckless]: "Death or Glory" - Needs extreme risk for peak performance
  Source: Combat stim addiction, near-death experiences
  Visual: Pupils dilate, muscles tense for impossible maneuvers
  Weakness: Safe situations bore him, performs poorly when cautious
  Personality: Seeks increasingly dangerous thrills
```

## **GM Integration Benefits**

### **Automatic Story Hooks**
Each tag manifestation provides:
- **Weakness to exploit** for complications
- **Strength to showcase** for spotlight moments  
- **NPCs to introduce** (mentors, rivals, students)
- **Scenarios to design** around tag themes

### **Tag-Driven Scenarios**
**Example: "The Heist"**
- **[Digital]** characters: Hack security systems
- **[Subtle]** characters: Avoid detection
- **[Social]** characters: Con the guards
- **[Brutal]** characters: Fight when stealth fails
- **[Technical]** characters: Bypass physical locks

### **Complication Economy**
When tag **limitations** create problems:
- **Minor (-1 die)**: 1 Advancement Point bonus
- **Major (can't use tag)**: 2 AP bonus
- **Severe (opposite effect)**: 3 AP bonus
