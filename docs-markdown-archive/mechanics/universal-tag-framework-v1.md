# Universal Tag Framework v1.0
## The Core Language of Cosmos Engine

### Introduction

Tags are the narrative DNA of Cosmos Engine - descriptive keywords that define how characters, equipment, vehicles, and environments interact. This framework establishes the universal language that connects every element of the game through meaningful, discoverable synergies.

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Universal Language**
Every game element uses the same tag vocabulary:
- **Characters** have tags from skills (how they act)
- **Equipment** has tags from construction (what it enables)
- **Vehicles** have tags from design (how they perform)
- **Locations** have tags from nature (where things happen)
- **Everything** can gain tags through use and story

#### 2. **Meaningful Combinations**
Tags combine to create emergent effects:
- **Matching tags** reinforce each other (+1 to +5 dice)
- **Complementary tags** create new capabilities
- **Opposing tags** force interesting choices
- **Rare combinations** unlock legendary effects

#### 3. **Living Evolution**
Nothing is static in Cosmos Engine:
- **Equipment** develops personality through use
- **Vehicles** adapt to their pilots
- **Locations** remember significant events
- **Characters** influence their tools

#### 4. **Narrative First**
Every tag tells a story:
- Tags describe fiction, not just mechanics
- Players name their discovered synergies
- Legendary combinations become campaign lore
- Tags create roleplaying opportunities

### Tag Categories

#### Style Tags (How)
Describe approach and methodology:
- **[Aggressive]** - Direct, forceful, overwhelming

- **[Brutal]** - Savage, intimidating, destructive
- **[Elegant]** - Graceful, efficient, refined

#### Source Tags (Origin)
Describe power source or creation:
- **[Natural]** - Inherent, organic, evolved
- **[Enhanced]** - Augmented, modified, improved
- **[Trained]** - Learned, practiced, mastered
- **[Experimental]** - Untested, volatile, unique
- **[Ancient]** - Historical, proven, mysterious
- **[Alien]** - Foreign, strange, incomprehensible

#### Domain Tags (Sphere)
Describe area of influence:
- **[Physical]** - Material, tangible, mechanical
- **[Digital]** - Electronic, data, networked
- **[Psionic]** - Mental, psychic, consciousness
- **[Social]** - Cultural, interpersonal, political
- **[Environmental]** - Natural, ecological, terrain
- **[Quantum]** - Probability, dimensional, exotic

#### Quality Tags (Degree)
Describe level of excellence:
- **[Basic]** - Standard, functional, common
- **[Professional]** - Quality, reliable, tested
- **[Elite]** - Exceptional, rare, superior
- **[Masterwork]** - Perfect, unique, artistic
- **[Legendary]** - Mythic, famous, storied
- **[Transcendent]** - Reality-defying, impossible

### Synergy Mechanics

#### Basic Synergy (+1 die)
When two tags share thematic space:
- [Precise] weapon + [Patient] character
- [Digital] armor + [Networked] location
- [Fast] vehicle + [Lightning] pilot

#### Strong Synergy (+2 dice)
When tags directly complement:
- [Enhanced] character + [Smart] weapon
- [Stealth] armor + [Silent] character
- [Responsive] ship + [Intuitive] pilot

#### Perfect Synergy (+3 dice)
When tags create unified whole:
- [Digital] + [Networked] + [Hacker] = "Ghost in the Machine"
- [Brutal] + [Aggressive] + [Fearless] = "Unstoppable Force"
- [Precise] + [Patient] + [Focused] = "Perfect Moment"

#### Legendary Synergy (+4-5 dice)
When rare combinations align:
- Requires 4+ matching tags across multiple sources
- Often involves environmental factors
- Creates unique, named abilities
- May transcend normal scale limitations

#### Tag Opposition (-1 to -2 dice)
When tags conflict:
- [Subtle] weapon in [Brutal] hands
- [Elegant] armor with [Reckless] pilot
- [Ancient] tech in [Digital] environment
- Player must choose which aspect dominates

### Evolution Mechanics

#### Usage Evolution (10+ sessions)
Equipment gains tags reflecting use:
- Weapons: [Trusted], [Bloodthirsty], [Merciful]
- Armor: [Scarred], [Lucky], [Protective]
- Vehicles: [Reliable], [Temperamental], [Loyal]
- Tools: [Intuitive], [Quirky], [Perfectionist]

#### Story Evolution (Major events)
Significant moments create tags:
- Surviving destruction: [Unbreaking]
- Killing legend: [Dragonslayer]
- Saving lives: [Guardian]
- Betrayal: [Bitter]

#### Bonding Evolution (100+ hours use)
Deep connection creates unique tags:
- Character-specific: [Sarah's], [Marcus-Tuned]
- Awakening tags: [Aware], [Willing], [Rebellious]
- Destiny tags: [Fated], [Chosen], [Cursed]

#### Environmental Evolution (Location exposure)
Places leave their mark:
- Space exposure: [Void-Touched]
- Combat zones: [Battle-Hardened]
- Holy sites: [Blessed]
- Quantum fields: [Reality-Bent]

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Tag Limits
Prevent overwhelming complexity:
- **Characters**: 1 tag per skill rank
- **Equipment**: 1-6 tags based on Tech Level
- **Vehicles**: 3-8 tags based on size/complexity
- **Locations**: 3-5 environmental tags

#### Discovery Methods
How players find synergies:
- **Experimentation**: Try combinations in play
- **Research**: Study ancient texts or databases
- **Observation**: Watch NPCs demonstrate
- **Crisis**: Discover under pressure
- **Teaching**: Learn from masters

#### Recording Synergies
Track discovered combinations:
- Player names the synergy
- Note mechanical effect
- Record first use story
- Synergy becomes signature move

#### Balancing Power
Keep synergies meaningful but not overwhelming:
- Maximum +5 dice from all tag sources
- Legendary synergies limited to once per session
- Some synergies have costs or consequences
- Power attracts attention and enemies

### Design Philosophy

The Universal Tag Framework transforms Cosmos Engine from a game about numbers into a game about relationships. Every piece of equipment has personality. Every location has character. Every combination tells a story.

This creates a game where:
- A pilot's bond with their ship matters as much as their skill
- A soldier's trusted rifle outperforms technically superior weapons  
- Perfect synchronization creates legendary moments
- Discovery and experimentation reward more than optimization

Tags are not just mechanical bonuses - they are the language through which the game world speaks to the players, and through which players shape their own legends.

### Next Steps

With this framework established, we can now:
1. Write Chapter 5 with full tag integration
2. Update equipment chapters to use universal tags
3. Create vehicle/starship tag rules
4. Develop location/environment tag guidelines
5. Design adventures that showcase tag synergies

The Universal Tag Framework is the beating heart of Cosmos Engine - simple enough to learn, deep enough to explore forever.
