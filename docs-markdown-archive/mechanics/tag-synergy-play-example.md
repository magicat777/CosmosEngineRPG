## Synergies in Action

### Turn 1: Approach Phase

**Sarah's Infiltration**:
- Sarah's [Electronic] + Suit's [Adaptive] + Station's [Networked] = **"Digital Ghost Protocol"** (+3 dice)
- She doesn't just become invisible - she becomes part of the station's data stream
- Security cameras show looped footage of empty corridors
- Her presence registers as routine maintenance subroutines

**Marcus's Overwatch**:
- Marcus's [Digital] + [Tactical] + Rifle's [Smart] + Station's [Surveilled] = **"Omniscient Marksman"** (+4 dice)
- He hacks into station security from his fighter
- His rifle's targeting system highlights threats through walls
- Can fire through data ports to hit targets anywhere on station

### Turn 2: Complication - Quantum Security

The station's [Quantum-Shielded] tag activates, attempting to block their [Digital] tags.

**Tag Conflict Resolution**:
- Station's [Quantum-Shielded] vs Team's [Digital] tags
- GM rules: -2 dice to all digital actions OR find alternative approach

**Creative Solution - Tag Evolution**:
- Dr. Yamamoto uses Medical [Quantum Biology] + Tech [Experimental]
- Creates **"Quantum Virus"** - biological data that bypasses shields
- Team's [Digital] tags now function as [Quantum-Digital] for scene

### Turn 3: Data Extraction

**Triple Character Synergy**:
- Marcus [Neural-Linked] + Sarah [Ghost] + Kai [Quantum Biology] 
- Combined with Station [Networked] = **"Consciousness Cascade"** (+5 dice)
- They don't just steal data - they BECOME the data
- Information flows through their linked consciousness
- Station's AI experiences existential crisis

### Turn 4: Escape Complications

Security responds with [Brutal] [Enhanced] guards wielding [Kinetic] [Suppression] weapons.

**Environmental Cascade**:
- Zara triggers station's [Zero-G Sections]
- Marcus's [Aerospace] + Fighter's [Responsive] in [Zero-G] = **"Void Dancer"** (+3 dice)
- His fighter maneuvers INSIDE the station's cargo bay
- [Kinetic] weapons become liability in zero-g (guards hit themselves)

### Turn 5: Legendary Moment

**Scale Transcendence Synergy**:
- Sarah discovers her Whisper Blade has hidden [Justice] tag
- Combines with her [Shadow-Walker] + Station's massive [Networked] database
- Achieves **"Truth's Shadow"** - legendary synergy
- Every corrupt corporate secret in the database manifests as shadow copies
- Shadows spread through network to every corporate terminal in the sector
- One personal-scale action affects an entire galactic corporation

## Synergy Rewards

### Immediate Benefits
- **Discovered Synergies**: Each player notes new synergies on character sheet
- **Advancement Points**: 2 AP for creative tag use, 3 AP for discovering legendary synergy
- **Equipment Evolution**: 
  - Marcus's rifle gains [Station-Breaker] tag
  - Sarah's blade begins awakening process
  - The station itself gains [Compromised] tag

### Long-term Consequences
- **Reputation**: "The Ghost Breach" becomes legendary heist
- **Tag Contamination**: Crew starts developing [Synchronized] tags
- **Enemy Evolution**: Corporate security develops [Anti-Digital] countermeasures
- **Equipment Bonds**: Gear used in heist becomes [Legendary]
