# Equipment and Tag System Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current equipment, vehicle, and starship systems in Cosmos Engine RPG, I've identified significant opportunities for tag integration that would create emergent gameplay while maintaining the system's complexity budget. The tag system can enhance equipment without adding numerical inflation, create meaningful synergies between character abilities and gear, and provide a framework for cross-scale interactions.

## Current System Analysis

### Equipment Mechanics Overview

The current equipment system uses:
- **Technology Eras**: Six distinct levels (Primitive through Cosmic)
- **Equipment Ratings**: Capped at +0 to +3 (balanced scaling)
- **Damage Types**: Kinetic, Energy, Electromagnetic, Exotic
- **Tradeoff Design**: Every item has strengths and weaknesses
- **Scale Integration**: Personal → Vehicle → Starship → Capital

### Vehicle and Starship Systems

Vehicles operate with:
- **Four Scales**: Personal, Vehicle, Starship, Capital (×10 damage multipliers)
- **Core Statistics**: Speed, Handling, Armor, Structure/Hull, Shields
- **Crew Roles**: Captain, Pilot, Gunner, Engineer, Science Officer
