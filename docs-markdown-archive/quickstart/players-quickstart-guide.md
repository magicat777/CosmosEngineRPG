   - Easy: 8
   - Moderate: 11
   - Hard: 14
   - Extreme: 17
   - Legendary: 20

2. You roll:

3. Results:
   - **Beat the target**: Success!
   - **Beat by 10+**: Critical success!
   - **Miss by 10+**: Critical failure!

### Combat in 30 Seconds

**Each Round**:
1. Roll Initiative (once per combat)
2. On your turn, pick one:
   - **Attack**: Roll Combat skill vs Defense
   - **Move**: Change position
   - **Other Action**: Anything else

**Attacking**:
- Roll: 2d10 + Coordination + (Combat/2)
- If you hit: Deal weapon damage
- Damage = Weapon + (success margin/2)

**Getting Hit**:
- Subtract damage from HP
- At 0 HP: Unconscious
- At negative Might: Dying

**Weapons** (Simple):
- Pistol: 2d10 damage
- Rifle: 3d10 damage
- Sword: 2d10+2 damage

## Example of Play

**GM**: "The alien smuggler demands twice the agreed price for the hyperdrive part."

**Sarah (playing Zara)**: "I'll try to persuade him to honor our deal. I have Presence 4 and Persuasion 2."

**GM**: "This is a Moderate task, so difficulty 11."

**Sarah**: *Rolls 2d10, gets 7* "That's 7 + 4 + 1 = 12. Success!"

**GM**: "The smuggler grumbles but agrees. 'Fine, but you owe me a favor...'"
