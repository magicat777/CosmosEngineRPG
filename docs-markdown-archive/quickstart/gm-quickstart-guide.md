# Cosmos Engine RPG - GM's Quick-Start Guide

Get your first session running in 15 minutes!

## Core GM Principles

1. **Say "Yes, and..." or "Yes, but..."** - Keep the story moving
2. **When in doubt, call for a roll** - Difficulty 11 for most tasks
3. **Failure should be interesting** - Not just "nothing happens"
4. **The rules serve the fun** - Ignore them if needed

## Quick Rules Summary

### Basic Roll
- **2d10 + Attribute + (Skill/2)**
- Compare to Difficulty:
  - 8 = Easy (75% for average character)
  - 11 = Moderate (50%)

  - 17 = Extreme (10%)
  - 20 = Legendary (2%)

### When to Roll

## Your First Adventure: "Emergency at Kappa Station"

### Setup (Read to Players)
*"Your cargo ship receives a distress signal from Kappa Mining Station. 'Emergency... systems failing... please help...' Then static. The station is 2 hours away. Corporate regulations say you should report it and wait for authorities. But people might be dying..."*

### Key Information
- Small mining station, 20 workers
- Processes rare minerals
- Isolated location
- Players know: It pays well for deliveries

### What Really Happened
Power core malfunction released dangerous radiation. Most workers evacuated, but 3 are trapped in the sealed processing bay. Station's AI has gone haywire, treating everyone as intruders.

### Scene 1: Approach
- **Perception check (11)**: Notice no ships at docking bay
- **Tech check (11)**: Detect radiation leak
- **Pilot check (8)**: Dock safely despite failing guidance

### Scene 2: Entry
Station is dark, emergency lights only.
- **First Room**: Empty security checkpoint
  - Tech (11): Access logs - evacuation 6 hours ago
  - Perception (14): Blood drops leading deeper
- **Complication**: Security robot activates!
  - Use "Soldier" stats
  - Shouts "INTRUDER ALERT" repeatedly

### Scene 3: The Choice
Find 3 workers trapped behind radiation-proof door.
- **Problem**: Opening door floods corridor with radiation
- **Solutions** (let players be creative!):
  - Fix radiation leak (Tech 14)
  - Find EVA suits (Survival 11)
  - Override AI (Tech 17)
  - Convince AI they're maintenance (Deception 14)

### Scene 4: Escape
Whatever solution, complicate it:
- Radiation leak worsens (timer pressure)
- More security robots activate
- Station begins emergency lockdown
- Rival salvage crew arrives

### Resolution
- **Save all 3**: Heroes! Monetary reward + reputation
- **Save some**: Bittersweet victory, smaller reward
- **Save none**: Failure, but learned valuable info about AI virus spreading through sector...

## GM Best Practices

### Say "Yes" Examples
- **Player**: "Is there a chandelier I can swing from?"
- **You**: "Yes! Roll Athletics, difficulty 11."

- **Player**: "Do I know anyone in this city?"
- **You**: "Yes, but... they might not be happy to see you. Who is it?"

### Making Failure Interesting
- **Failed Stealth**: You're not detected, but you knock something over. You have seconds before guards investigate.
- **Failed Tech**: You hack the door, but trigger an alarm. It opens, but now you're on a timer.
- **Failed Social**: They don't believe you, but they're intrigued. They want you to prove it.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Too Easy?** Add complications, not higher numbers
- **Too Hard?** Let them find advantages, allies, or alternate routes
- **Just Right?** Keep that tension!
