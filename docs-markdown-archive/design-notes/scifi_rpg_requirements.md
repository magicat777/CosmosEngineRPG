# Science Fiction RPG System - Requirements Document v1.0

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** [To Be Determined]
**Project Type:** Tabletop Role-Playing Game System
**Genre:** Science Fiction
**Target Completion:** [Timeline TBD]

### Vision Statement
To create a comprehensive science fiction RPG system featuring an elegant, scalable dice mechanic that generates natural probability curves while maintaining tactical depth and meaningful player choice across all levels of playâ€”from personal combat to fleet engagements.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Unified Scaling Mechanics
- Single dice system that works seamlessly from personal combat to starship battles
- Consistent resolution mechanics across all subsystems
- Scalable difficulty and complexity without mechanical complexity

### 2. Natural Probability Distribution
- Multi-die mechanics that generate bell curves rather than flat probability
- Predictable baseline results with meaningful variance
- Reduced "swingy" outcomes that dominate entire scenes

### 3. Tactical Depth with Accessibility
- Meaningful choices between weapons, equipment, and abilities
- Granular enough for tactical significance, simple enough for quick resolution
- Clear modifiers that are intuitive to assign and calculate

### 4. Comprehensive Subsystem Integration
- Robust hacking/cybernetics rules
- Detailed vehicle and starship combat
- Remote operations and drone management
- Social/political intrigue mechanics

### 5. Meaningful Progression Systems
- Tangible rewards including equipment, credits, and advancement
- Multiple advancement vectors (skills, equipment, reputation, resources)
- Player agency in character development paths

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience
- Experienced RPG players (5+ years) seeking tactical depth
- Game Masters comfortable with moderate complexity
- Groups who enjoy both roleplay and tactical combat
- Players frustrated with existing sci-fi systems' limitations
