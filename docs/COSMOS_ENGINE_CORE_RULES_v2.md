# Introduction

Cosmos Engine is a science fiction tabletop RPG that lets you play heroes across the galaxy, from street-level investigators to reality-shaping legends. The game uses a unified 2d10 system that scales seamlessly from personal action to galactic-scale operations.

## What You Need to Play

- 2-6 players (including one Game Master)
- One complete polyhedral dice set per player (d4, d6, d8, 2d10, d12, d20)
  - 2d10 for all skill checks and core mechanics
  - Other dice for damage rolls and special effects
- Character sheets
- Paper and pencils

## Design Principles

**Universal Resolution**: One 2d10 system handles all actions across all scales.

**Meaningful Choices**: Every decision should present interesting tradeoffs.

**Scalable Adventure**: Start as local heroes, become galactic legends.

**Technology Progression**: Advancement unlocks new capabilities, not just bigger numbers.

**Streamlined Complexity**: Depth without overwhelming detail.

---

# Core Mechanics

## Universal Resolution System

Everything in Cosmos Engine uses the same core mechanic:

**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment + Situation vs Target Number**

### Core Components

- **2d10**: Roll two ten-sided dice and add results (2-20 range)
- **Attribute**: One of six PRIMAC attributes (1-10 range)
- **Skill**: Relevant skill rating (0-5 range)
- **Equipment**: Technology bonus (0-6 by era)
- **Situation**: Consolidated modifier (-3 to +3)

### Target Numbers

| Difficulty | TN | Description |
|------------|----|-----------  |
| **Trivial** | 9 | Almost impossible to fail |
| **Easy** | 11 | Routine task under pressure |
| **Moderate** | 14 | Standard difficulty |
| **Hard** | 17 | Requires expertise |
| **Extreme** | 20 | Pushes human limits |
| **Legendary** | 23+ | Beyond normal possibility |

### Critical Results

**Natural 20** (rolled exactly 20 on 2d10):
- Always succeeds regardless of difficulty
- Triggers special effects in combat
- Exceptional success in non-combat

**Natural 2** (rolled exactly 2 on 2d10):
- Always fails regardless of bonuses
- Equipment degradation check required
- Dramatic complication

### The Dice Curve

2d10 creates a probability curve that rewards competent characters:
- Average roll: 11
- 75% chance of rolling 8+
- 25% chance of rolling 15+
- Natural results (2, 20) occur 1% of the time

This means skilled characters succeed reliably at appropriate tasks while maintaining tension for challenging situations.

### Assistance Mechanics

Characters can help each other with tasks, providing bonuses to the primary actor:

#### Simple Assistance (Default)
Used for straightforward physical or mental tasks where extra hands make a difference:
- Each helper adds **+1** to the primary actor's roll
- **Maximum bonus**: +3 (more helpers just get in the way)
- **Requirement**: Helper must have relevant attribute 3+ (average human)
- **Examples**: Lifting heavy objects, searching rooms, brainstorming

#### Skilled Assistance (Complex Tasks)  
Used for technical or specialized tasks where expertise matters:
- Helpers must succeed on **TN 11** check using same attribute + skill
- **Success**: Adds **+2** to primary actor's roll
- **Failure**: No bonus (but no penalty - they tried to help)
- **Critical Failure** (natural 2): **-1** to primary roll (actively hindered)
- **Examples**: Surgery, hacking, engineering repairs, scientific research

#### Determining Assistance Type
- **Physical labor**: Simple (lifting, pushing, digging)
- **Basic mental tasks**: Simple (memory, basic math, searching)
- **Specialized work**: Skilled (medicine, tech, piloting)
- **Creative tasks**: GM's choice based on complexity

## Skill Ratings

- **0**: Untrained (use attribute only, personal scale only)
- **1**: Novice (basic training, unlocks vehicle scale)
- **2**: Trained (professional competency, advanced vehicles)
- **3**: Expert (advanced capability, unlocks starship scale)

# Saving Throws

When characters face effects that bypass normal defenses or inflict conditions beyond simple damage, they make saving throws. These represent a character's ability to resist, endure, or overcome harmful effects.

# Combat System

The Cosmos Engine combat system uses the universal 2d10 resolution mechanic to create tactical, fast-paced encounters across all scales of play.

## Combat Overview

### Universal Combat Formula
**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment + Situation vs Target Number**

**Core Components**:
- **Attribute**: Coordination (ranged), Might (melee), or other as appropriate
- **Skill**: Combat skill or relevant specialization
- **Equipment**: Weapon/armor rating (+0 to +6 by technology era)

#### Healthy (100-75% HP)
- No penalties or visible effects
- Character operates at peak performance

#### Bloodied (74-50% HP)
- Visible injuries (cuts, bruises, minor burns)
- No mechanical penalties (heroic resilience)
- Other characters can see you're hurt

#### Wounded (49-25% HP)
- Significant injuries (bleeding, burns, fractures)
- **-1 penalty** to all actions
- Clearly struggling but still fighting

#### Critical (24-10% HP)

  - **Heroic**: Unconscious but stable
  - **Gritty**: Dying (requires death saves)
  - **Cinematic**: Dramatically injured but conscious

## Damage Application

### Wound Thresholds
When taking damage equal to these percentages of maximum HP in a single hit:

#### Minor Wound (10% of max HP)
- No immediate mechanical effect
- Visible injury for roleplay

#### Moderate Wound (20% of max HP)

- **Might Save (TN 17)** or suffer Physical Disabled for 1 round

#### Grievous Wound (40% of max HP)
- **Automatic** Physical Disabled for 1 round
- **Might Save (TN 20)** or fall to Critical health state

### Critical Hits
**Natural 20** on attack rolls trigger critical effects. The attacker chooses ONE:

1. **Maximum Damage**: Deal maximum possible damage on all dice
2. **Brutal Strike**: Normal damage + inflict Physical Impaired (no save)
3. **Penetrating Strike**: Normal damage + ignore all armor/defenses
4. **Devastating Blow**: Normal damage + trigger next Wound Threshold

# Designer's Notes

## Core Philosophy

Cosmos Engine emerged from a desire to create a science fiction RPG that could handle stories spanning from street-level investigation to galaxy-shaping conflicts while maintaining mechanical consistency. The 2d10 system provides the probability curve needed for competent heroes while preserving dramatic tension through critical results.

## Key Changes in Version 4.0

### 1-10 Attribute Scale
The expansion from 1-5 to 1-10 attributes provides more granular character progression and clearer distinctions between human, heroic, and legendary capabilities. This creates a more satisfying advancement curve across all 20 levels.

### Enhanced HP System
The new HP formula (40 + MightÃ—8 + ResolveÃ—4) creates tactical combat where positioning and conditions matter more than lucky rolls. With starting HP of 52-120, characters can survive multiple hits while still feeling threatened by focused fire or critical strikes.

### Comprehensive Saving Throws
Every attribute now provides defensive value through the saving throw system. This ensures no attribute is a "dump stat" and creates more diverse character builds.

### Wound Thresholds
Big hits trigger conditions rather than instant death. This creates dramatic moments without removing players from the action through random chance.

### Adjusted Target Numbers
All TNs increased by +3 to maintain appropriate challenge levels with the expanded attribute range. This preserves game balance while providing more room for character growth.

## Design Goals Achieved

**Universal Resolution**: Every action uses the same core mechanic, reducing cognitive load.

**Meaningful Progression**: Characters advance from competent humans to godlike beings through clear mechanical tiers.

**Tactical Combat**: Higher HP pools and wound thresholds create engaging combat that rewards smart play over lucky rolls.

**Scale Flexibility**: Adventures seamlessly transition from personal drama to galactic conflict.

**Complexity Management**: The system provides depth for experienced players while remaining accessible through clear presentation.

## Future Development

This second edition represents a mature, balanced game system ready for extensive play. Future development will focus on:
- GM resources and guidance materials
- Setting frameworks and campaign structures
- Digital tools and play aids
- Expanded adventure content
- Community feedback integration

The foundation is stronger than ever. The galaxy awaits your stories.
