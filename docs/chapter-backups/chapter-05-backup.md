# Chapter 5: Actions and Skills

Skills represent your character's training, experience, and expertise in various fields. In Cosmos Engine, skills operate on a simple **7×15 progression system** that scales seamlessly from personal actions to commanding galactic fleets. Each skill advancement grants not only mechanical benefits but also **narrative tags** [that have both tactical and roleplay benefits] that define *how* your abilities manifest, creating rich character differentiation and story hooks.

## 5.1 Using Skills

### Basic Skill Resolution

The core mechanic remains elegantly simple:

**Basic Skill Check**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers vs Target Number

When attempting a task with uncertain outcome:
1. GM determines which skill applies
2. Player chooses appropriate attribute pairing  
3. GM sets Target Number (TN) based on difficulty
4. Roll dice and compare to TN
5. Apply any relevant **tag bonuses**

### Tag-Enhanced Resolution

**Tags** are narrative descriptors that grant mechanical benefits when applicable. Each skill rank grants one tag that describes *how* your ability manifests:

**Tag Bonus**: +1 to +5 dice when circumstances perfectly match your tags

**Examples**:
- Marcus has Combat [Enhanced] - gains +2 dice on attacks when his neural targeting system can function
- Sarah has Tech [Digital] - gains +3 dice on skill checks when directly interfacing with computer networks  
- Chen has Pilot [Reckless] - gains +2 dice on piloting checks for dangerous maneuvers, -1 die for safe flying (hey, it's stressful flying slower than EVERYEONE else)

### Skill Ratings and Progression

Skills progress through **ten ranks and seven distinct tiers** representing mastery at different scales:

| Ranks  | Tier         | Scale                 | Description           | Tag Examples
|------ |------         |-------                |-------------          |-------------- |
| 1     | Apprentice-I  | Personal              | Basic competency      | [Trained], [Enhanced], [Instinctive]
| 2     | Apprentice-II | Personal → Vehicle    | Developing expertise  | [Precise], [Aggressive], [Subtle]
| 3     | Journeyman-I  | Vehicle               | Professional level    | [Leadership], [Tactical], [Creative]
| 4-5   | Journeyman-II | Vehicle → Starship    | Exceptional ability   | [Veteran], [Adaptive], [Fearless]
| 6-7   | Master-I      | Starship              | Sector-renowned       | [Elite], [Specialist], [Polymath]
| 8-9   | Master-II     | Starship → Fleet      | Legendary mastery     | [Mythic], [Transcendent], [Legendary]
| 10    | Grandmaster   | Fleet                 | Reality-defining      | [Warmaster], [Void Master], [The Unbroken]

**Character Creation Limit**: Skills begin at maximum Rank 3, representing extensive training or exceptional talent.

**Advancement Only**: Ranks 4+ can only be gained through play using Advancement Points, representing experience that comes from actual use rather than initial education.

### Attribute Pairings

Most skills have a primary attribute but can pair with others for specific applications:

**Combat Examples**:
- **Combat + Might**: Melee attacks, breaking objects
- **Combat + Coordination**: Ranged attacks, quick draws  
- **Combat + Awareness**: Tactical assessment, ambush detection
- **Combat + Intellect**: Analyzing fighting styles, planning battles

The GM determines which pairing fits the situation, or players can suggest creative applications.

## 5.2 Scale Integration

One of Cosmos Engine's defining features is **cross-scale consistency** - the same skills work from personal duels to commanding galactic fleets:

### Scale Progression

**Personal Scale (Ranks 1-2)**: Individual actions and small team coordination
- Combat: Personal weapons, hand-to-hand fighting
- Pilot: Personal vehicles, basic maneuvers
- Tech: Personal devices, simple programming

**Vehicle Scale (Rank 3)**: Vehicle operations and squad-level coordination  
- Combat: Vehicle-mounted weapons, squad tactics
- Pilot: Complex vehicles, formation flying
- Tech: Vehicle systems, network coordination

**Starship Scale (Ranks 4-6)**: Capital ship operations and fleet coordination
- Combat: Ship weapons, boarding actions, point defense
- Pilot: Starship operations, fleet maneuvers
- Tech: Ship computers, jump drive calculations

**Fleet Scale (Ranks 7-10)**: Strategic operations and galactic influence
- Combat: Fleet tactics, strategic warfare
- Pilot: Multi-ship formations, galactic navigation
- Tech: Network-wide systems, technological evolution

### Tag Evolution Across Scales

As skills advance, tags evolve to reflect increased scope and power:

**Example - Combat Progression**:
- Rank 1: [Enhanced] - "Neural targeting implant"
- Rank 3: [Enhanced] + [Tactical] - "Squad coordination through neural link"  
- Rank 6: [Enhanced] + [Tactical] + [Elite] - "Ship crew neural network"
- Rank 10: [Enhanced] + [Tactical] + [Elite] + [Warmaster] - "Fleet-wide tactical consciousness"

The mechanical benefits remain constant, but the narrative scope expands dramatically.

## 5.3 Tag System Overview

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are narrative descriptors that explain *how* your skills manifest. They provide:
- **Mechanical bonuses** when circumstances match (+1 to +5 dice)
- **Story hooks** for GMs to create compelling scenarios
- **Character differentiation** - same skills, completely different characters
- **Cross-skill synergies** when compatible tags combine

### Tag Categories

**Style Tags** describe *how* you approach tasks:
- [Precise]: Surgical accuracy, measured approach
- [Brutal]: Overwhelming force, intimidating presence  
- [Subtle]: Hidden action, misdirection
- [Aggressive]: Forward momentum, taking initiative

**Source Tags** explain *where* abilities come from:
- [Enhanced]: Technological augmentation
- [Trained]: Dedicated learning and practice
- [Innate]: Natural talent or genetic gift
- [Experimental]: Untested methods or prototypes

**Domain Tags** specify *what* your skills affect:
- [Digital]: Computer systems, networks, data
- [Social]: Interpersonal, cultural, emotional
- [Environmental]: Natural world, survival, adaptation
- [Mechanical]: Physical devices, engineering

### Tag Manifestation

Each tag requires documentation of how it appears in the world:

**Example Tag Documentation**:
```
CHARACTER: Sarah "Ghost" Martinez
STEALTH [Digital]: "Phantom Protocol" 
- Source: Experimental military hacking implant
- Visual: Eyes flicker with data streams when active
- Effect: Invisible to electronic sensors, can "edit" camera feeds
- Weakness: EMP, network dead zones, power drain
- Personality: Sometimes talks to security systems like pets
```

This creates rich roleplaying opportunities and gives the GM specific tools for complications and spotlight moments.

## 5.4 Tag Synergies and Combinations

### Synergy Levels

When tags from different skills work together, they create powerful combinations:

**Perfect Synergy (+3 dice)**
- Tags that naturally amplify each other
- Creates new emergent abilities  
- Example: [Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect Moment" - Time seems to slow

**Strong Synergy (+2 dice)**
- Tags that work well together
- Standard compatibility bonus
- Example: [Digital] + [Technical] = "Technomancy" - Bend technology to will

**Basic Synergy (+1 die)**
- Tags that complement without conflict
- Minor benefit for coordination
- Example: [Enhanced] + [Trained] = "Optimized Performance" - Tech meets skill

**Conflict (-1 to -2 dice)**
- Tags that oppose each other
- Creates internal tension
- Example: [Brutal] + [Subtle] = Must choose force or finesse

### Multi-Tag Combinations

Advanced characters can chain multiple tags for extraordinary effects:

**Triple Synergy Examples**:
- [Precise] + [Patient] + [Digital] = "Quantum Targeting" (+4 dice, reality-bending accuracy)
- [Brutal] + [Enhanced] + [Aggressive] = "Cybernetic Rampage" (+4 dice, unstoppable force)
- [Subtle] + [Social] + [Creative] = "Master Manipulator" (+4 dice, invisible influence)

### Cross-Skill Tag Webs

When tags from multiple skills interconnect, they create character-defining abilities:

**Example: The Digital Warrior**
- Combat: [Enhanced] - Neural combat implants
- Tech: [Digital] - Consciousness in the network  
- Pilot: [Technical] - Ships as extended body
- **Web Effect**: "Omnipresent Warrior" - Fight through any connected system

### Synergy Discovery

Players discover new combinations through:
- **Experimentation**: Trying creative tag combinations
- **Training Together**: Characters with compatible tags working together
- **Story Evolution**: Major events creating new synergistic possibilities

**GM Rewards**: Award 1-3 Advancement Points for discovering particularly creative or story-relevant synergies.
