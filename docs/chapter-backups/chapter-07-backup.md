# Chapter 7: Equipment and Gear

Equipment in Cosmos Engine spans from primitive tools to reality-bending technology. This chapter covers weapons, armor, general equipment, and the economic systems that govern their availability across the galaxy.

## Equipment Fundamentals

### Technology Eras

Equipment is categorized by six technology eras, each representing major advances in capability:

**Primitive Era**: Pre-industrial technology
- Natural materials (wood, stone, bone)
- Simple mechanical devices
- Animal-powered transportation

**Industrial Era**: Mass production begins
- Firearms and combustion engines
- Basic electronics
- Steel and early plastics

**Advanced Era**: Information age
- Computers and networks
- Advanced materials
- Precision manufacturing

**Stellar Era**: Interstellar civilization
- Energy weapons standard
- Gravity manipulation
- FTL communication

**Cosmic Era**: Reality manipulation
- Dimensional technology
- Consciousness transfer
- Localized physics control

### Equipment Scaling (Balanced System)

To maintain game balance across all levels, equipment bonuses are capped:

**Maximum Equipment Bonuses**:
- Primitive/Industrial: +0 to +1
- Advanced: +1 to +2
- Stellar: +2 to +3
- Cosmic: +3 (with special properties)

This prevents numerical inflation while keeping equipment meaningful at all levels.

### Quality Levels

Within each era, equipment has quality tiers:

| Quality | Bonus | Cost Multiplier | Availability |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Inferior | -1 | ×0.5 | Common |
| Standard | +0 | ×1 | Common |
