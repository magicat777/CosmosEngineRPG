# Mass Combat System

## Overview

Mass Combat represents large-scale battles involving hundreds to millions of participants - from planetary invasions to galactic fleet engagements. The system builds on our established mechanics while abstracting individual actions into unit-based warfare that maintains tactical depth and narrative engagement.

**Scale Applications**:
- **Battalion Combat**: 100-1,000 participants (ground armies, fighter wings)
- **Division Combat**: 1,000-10,000 participants (planetary campaigns, fleet battles)
- **Strategic Combat**: 10,000+ participants (multi-world campaigns, galactic wars)

**Design Goals**:
- Integrate seamlessly with personal/starship combat
- Allow heroes to impact massive battles meaningfully
- Maintain tactical decisions without overwhelming complexity
- Support combined arms across all technology levels
- Enable dramatic narrative moments
