## Chase Resolution Framework

### Basic Chase Mechanics

#### Initiative and Turn Order
**Chase Initiative**: 1d10 + Coordination + Pilot Skill
- Determines action order each round
- Re-roll initiative when vehicles change significantly
- Tied initiative: Defender (being chased) acts first

#### Range Categories
| Range | Description | Modifiers | Actions Available |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Adjacent** | Ramming distance | Combat possible | All maneuvers, boarding |
| **Close** | Within weapons range | +1 to attacks | Most maneuvers, combat |
| **Medium** | Visual contact | +0 baseline | Basic maneuvers, long-range combat |
| **Long** | Sensor contact | -1 to attacks | Limited maneuvers, detection |
| **Extreme** | Edge of detection | -2 to attacks | Escape attempts, sensor work |

#### Basic Action Economy
- **Standard Action**: Complex maneuver, attack, special ability
- **Move Action**: Basic movement, simple maneuver, evasion
- **Quick Action**: Communication, sensor scan, simple system
- **Reaction**: Defensive maneuver, countermeasure

## Core Chase Actions

### Pilot Maneuvers
All maneuvers use: **2d10 + Coordination + (Pilot Skill รท 2) + Equipment + Situation**

#### Pursuit (Standard Action)
**Purpose**: Close distance with target
**TN**: 14 + Target's last Evasion result
**Success**: Reduce range by one category
**Failure**: No change in range
**Critical Success**: Reduce range by two categories, gain +1 to next action

#### Evasion (Standard Action)
**Purpose**: Increase distance from pursuer
**TN**: 14 + Pursuer's last Pursuit result
**Success**: Increase range by one category
**Failure**: No change in range
**Critical Success**: Increase range by two categories, force pursuer TN +2 next round

#### Ramming Attack (Standard Action)
**Requirements**: Adjacent range
**TN**: Target's Defense + 2
**Success**: Both vehicles take collision damage
**Damage**: 2d10 + Vehicle Scale + Speed modifier
**Risk**: Pilot takes damage equal to half dealt

#### Dangerous Maneuver (Standard Action)
**Purpose**: Gain tactical advantage through risky piloting
**TN**: 17 (varies by environment)
**Success**: +2 to next action, special positioning
**Failure**: Take environmental damage, lose next move action
**Examples**: Asteroid threading, urban weaving, atmospheric diving

### Combat Integration

## Damage and Consequences

### Vehicle Health System
Uses same framework as character health but scaled for vehicles:

**Vehicle HP**: Base HP + (Scale ร 50) + (Technology Era ร 25)
**Damage Thresholds**: Same percentages as character wounds

### System Damage
Instead of status conditions, vehicles suffer system failures:

| System | Effect of Damage | Repair Difficulty |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Propulsion** | Speed reduction, mobility loss | Technology + Might |
| **Sensors** | Detection penalties, navigation issues | Technology + Intellect |
| **Weapons** | Attack penalties, system offline | Technology + Coordination |
| **Life Support** | Crew health issues, time pressure | Technology + Intellect |
| **Communications** | Coordination penalties, isolation | Technology + Awareness |
| **Structural** | HP reduction, crash risk | Technology + Might |

### Crash Mechanics
When vehicles are reduced to 0 HP or fail critical systems:

**Crash Severity**: Determined by speed and circumstances
- **Controlled Landing**: Pilot TN 17, minimal damage
- **Hard Crash**: Pilot TN 20, significant damage to occupants
- **Catastrophic**: No save, maximum damage to all aboard

**Survival Rolls**: Might + Coordination vs damage-based TN
**Rescue Operations**: Technology + Medicine for emergency response
