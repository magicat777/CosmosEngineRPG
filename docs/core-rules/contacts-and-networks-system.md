# Contacts and Networks System

## Overview

The Contacts and Networks System manages social capital and relationship webs that characters build throughout their adventures. It integrates with the faction system and uses the balanced 2d10 mechanics to provide structured social gameplay without overwhelming complexity.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Social capital as valuable as equipment or wealth
- Networks provide access rather than guaranteed success
- Relationships require maintenance and reciprocity
- Integration with faction and organizational systems
- Scalable from personal contacts to galactic networks
