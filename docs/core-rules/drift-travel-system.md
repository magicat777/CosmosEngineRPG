# The Drift: FTL Travel System

## Overview

The **Drift** is humanity's primary method of faster-than-light travel, achieved by temporarily shifting vessels sideways through dimensional space into an alternate reality where distance operates under different physical laws. Ships appear to slide laterally across the field of stars for several perceived seconds before vanishing into the Drift dimension, emerging at their destination through a reverse process.

**Visual Experience**: Ships don't accelerate forward but drift sideways across space-time, creating a distinctive "sliding between the stars" aesthetic that distinguishes Drift travel from conventional propulsion or other FTL methods.

## The Drift Dimension

### Physical Properties

**Spatial Geography**: The Drift is a mostly empty dimensional space that roughly mirrors normal space topology, but with compressed distances. What takes years to cross in normal space might take weeks in the Drift.

**Visual Environment**: 
- Muted starfields with unfamiliar constellations
- Colors shifted toward blues and purples
- Distant lights that don't correspond to real-space objects
- Occasional "deep zones" with strange phenomena

**Physical Laws**:
- Normal physics mostly apply
- Distance compression varies by location (some areas faster than others)
- Time flows normally relative to ship's frame of reference
- Energy systems function normally

### Drift Zones

**Shallow Drift** (Safe Travel Corridors)
- Well-mapped routes between major systems
- Minimal hazards, predictable travel times
- Automatic navigation systems sufficient
- Equivalent to "highways" for interstellar travel

**Mid Drift** (Frontier Routes)
- Less charted areas requiring skilled navigation
- Occasional drift storms and spatial anomalies
- Potential encounters with derelicts or mysteries
- Faster routes for those willing to take risks

**Deep Drift** (Unexplored Regions)
- Uncharted areas with compressed time/distance
- Ancient ruins, strange phenomena, unknown inhabitants
- Extreme hazards but potentially vast shortcuts
- Requires expert navigation and preparation

## Drift Inhabitants & Phenomena

### Native Entities

**Drift Shepherds**
- Benevolent energy beings who maintain safe travel corridors
- Communicate through gravitational fluctuations
- Generally helpful to travelers in distress
- Ancient guardians of the dimensional space

**Echo Swarms**
- Psychic imprints of long-dead civilizations

- Can be interacted with but exist only in the Drift
- Source of ancient knowledge and mysterious technologies

**Void Wraiths**
- Predatory entities that feed on ship energy systems
- Attracted to poorly shielded Drift engines

### Abandoned Infrastructure

**Precursor Drift Gates**
- Ancient constructs that create stable Drift passages
- Built by unknown civilization millennia ago
- Some still functional, others dangerous ruins
- Key to accessing fastest travel routes

**Derelict Stations**
- Abandoned outposts from failed colonization attempts
- May contain valuable salvage or dangerous automated defenses
- Often serve as landmarks for navigation
- Some show signs of non-human construction

**Temporal Echoes**
- Regions where past events repeat continuously
- Ships from different eras may appear simultaneously
- Dangerous but sometimes provide historical insights
- Avoided by commercial traffic

## Travel Mechanics

### Basic Drift Navigation

**Required Components**:
- **Drift Engine**: Technology that shifts ship into Drift dimension
- **Navigation Computer**: Calculates route and dimensional coordinates
- **Drift Beacon**: Receives signals from navigation waypoints
- **Shielding**: Protects ship from dimensional interference

**Skill Applications**:

**Pilot + Awareness**: Basic navigation and course correction
*Standard difficulty for well-mapped routes*

**Pilot + Intellect**: Complex route calculation and optimization
*Required for efficient travel or avoiding hazards*

**Tech + Engineering**: Drift engine operation and maintenance
*Keeping systems operational during dimensional stress*

*"Drift sense" allows navigation by feel rather than instruments*

### Travel Time Scaling

**Distance Categories**:

**Local System** (0.1 to 50 AU)
- **Normal Space**: Hours to weeks via conventional propulsion
- **Drift**: Minutes to hours (primarily for emergency evacuation)
- **Note**: Drift rarely used for in-system travel due to setup time

**Regional Cluster** (1-25 light years)
- **Normal Space**: Years to decades at sublight
- **Drift**: 1-7 days via Shallow Drift routes
- **Examples**: Core worlds, trade networks, established colonies

**Sector Cross** (25-100 light years)
- **Normal Space**: Decades to centuries
- **Drift**: 1-4 weeks via established routes
- **Deep Drift**: 3-10 days via risky shortcuts

**Arm Traverse** (100-1,000 light years)
- **Normal Space**: Centuries to millennia
- **Drift**: 2-6 months via major trade routes
- **Deep Drift**: 2-8 weeks with extreme risk

**Galactic Cross** (1,000-100,000 light years)
- **Normal Space**: Millennia to impossible
- **Drift**: 6 months to 3 years depending on route
- **Deep Drift**: 2-12 months with cosmic-level risks

**Intergalactic** (100,000+ light years)
- **Normal Space**: Impossible at sub-cosmic scale
- **Drift**: 5-50 years (approaching cosmic scale requirements)
- **Deep Drift**: 1-10 years with reality-threatening hazards

### Technology Era Impact

- Standard travel times as listed above
- Commercial travel common between major systems

**Advanced Stellar Era** (Optimized)
