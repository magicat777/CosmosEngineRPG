# Cosmos Engine Attribute System (PRIMAC)

## Overview

Six core attributes define every character, vehicle, and organization in Cosmos Engine. These attributes use a 1-10 scale that represents the full spectrum from below-average humans to godlike beings. The system scales seamlessly from personal actions to galactic operations, maintaining consistent mechanics while adapting to context.

**PRIMAC**: Presence, Resolve, Intellect, Might, Awareness, Coordination

## Attribute Scale (1-10 System)

### Human Scale (1-6)
- **1-2**: Below Average (untrained, weak, disadvantaged)
- **3-4**: Average (normal human capability)
- **5-6**: Exceptional (professional athlete, genius, expert)

### Heroic Scale (7-8)
- **7**: Peak Human (world records, maximum human potential)
- **8**: Cinematic Hero (action movie protagonists, legendary figures)

### Legendary Scale (9-10)
- **9**: Mythic (demigod level, superhuman capability)
- **10**: Divine (godlike beings, cosmic entities)

## Character Creation

### Point Buy System
Characters receive **30 points** to distribute among the six attributes.

**Point Costs**:
- Ratings 1-6: 1 point per rating
- Ratings 7-8: 2 points per rating (requires 6 first)
- Starting Maximum: 7 (peak human)

**Example Starting Arrays**:
- **Specialist**: 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3 (expert with clear focus)
- **Balanced**: 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4 (competent all-rounder)
- **Dual Focus**: 6, 6, 4, 4, 3, 3 (two areas of expertise)

### Advancement Costs
Attributes advance slowly to reflect their fundamental nature:

| Current Rating | AP Cost | Character Level Required |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------|
| 1→2 | 2 AP | Any |
| 2→3 | 2 AP | Any |
| 3→4 | 3 AP | Any |
| 4→5 | 3 AP | Any |
| 5→6 | 3 AP | Any |
| 6→7 | 5 AP | Level 5+ |
| 7→8 | 5 AP | Level 10+ |
| 8→9 | 8 AP | Level 15+ |
| 9→10 | 8 AP | Level 20 only |

### Technology Enhancement
Technology amplifies but never replaces base attributes:
- **Primitive/Industrial**: No attribute enhancement
- **Advanced**: +1 effective attribute (temporary)
- **Stellar**: +2 effective attribute (temporary)
- **Cosmic**: +3 effective attribute (temporary)

### Cross-Scale Consistency
Same attributes represent different but analogous concepts at each scale, maintaining mechanical consistency while supporting varied fiction.

### Technology Integration
Higher technology eras provide temporary effective attribute increases through enhancement, not permanent changes to base attributes. This maintains human-centered gameplay while showcasing technological advancement.
