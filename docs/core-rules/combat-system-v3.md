# Combat System v3 - Balanced Edition

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine combat system uses the universal 2d10 resolution mechanic to create tactical, fast-paced encounters across all scales of play. This version implements a balanced progression system that maintains excitement throughout all character levels.

**Design Principles**:
- Meaningful choices over complex calculations
- Consistent challenge across all levels
- Combat skill affects both offense and defense
- Technology provides tactical options, not just bigger numbers
- Single resolution system across all scales
- Optional complexity for different play styles

**Balance Target**: Combat remains engaging from Level 1 through Level 20

---

## Core Combat Formulas (Balanced System)

### Attack Resolution
**Attack Roll**: 2d10 + Attribute + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Equipment + Situation

**Components**:
- **Attribute**: Coordination (ranged), Might (melee), or appropriate attribute
- **Combat Skill**: Divided by 2 (rounded up) to prevent runaway scaling
- **Equipment**: Weapon rating (+0 to +3 by technology era)
- **Situation**: Consolidated modifier (-3 to +3) covering range, cover, environment

### Defense Calculation
**Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Equipment

**Components**:
- **Base**: 10 (universal baseline)
- **Coordination**: Natural agility and reflexes
- **Combat Skill**: Defensive training, divided by 2 for balance
- **Cover**: +1 to +3 depending on cover quality
- **Equipment**: Armor, shields (+0 to +3 by technology era)

### Damage Resolution
**Damage**: Weapon Base + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Success Margin + Enhancements

**Components**:
- **Weapon Base**: Dice based on weapon type (1d6 to 3d6)
- **Combat Skill**: Skill with weapons adds to damage (÷ 2 for balance)
- **Success Margin**: +1 damage per 5 points over Defense TN
- **Enhancements**: Technology, ammunition, power allocation

## Initiative & Turn Order

### Initiative System
**Initiative**: 1d10 + Awareness + Coordination

**Process**:
1. All participants roll initiative at start of encounter
2. Act in descending order (highest to lowest)
3. Keep same order throughout entire encounter
4. On ties, PCs act before NPCs, then by highest Coordination

### Combat Round Structure

#### Phase 1: Initiative (First Round Only)
- Roll 1d10 + Awareness + Coordination
- Establish turn order for entire encounter

#### Phase 2: Declare Actions
- Players announce general intentions
- Can change specifics when turn arrives

#### Phase 3: Action Resolution
- Act in initiative order
- Resolve each character's full turn completely
- Apply damage and effects immediately

#### Phase 4: End of Round
- Apply ongoing effects (burning, bleeding, etc.)
- Advance status effect timers
- Check equipment degradation if triggered

---

## Action Economy

---

## Range & Positioning

### Universal Range Bands

Distance is abstracted into range bands that scale by operational level:

| Scale | Close | Short | Medium | Long | Extreme |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| **Personal** | 0-2m | 3-10m | 11-50m | 51-250m | 251m+ |
| **Vehicle** | 0-50m | 51-500m | 0.5-5km | 5-25km | 25km+ |
| **Starship** | 0-1km | 1-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000km+ |
| **Capital** | 0-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000-10000km | 10000km+ |

### Range Modifiers

**Applied to attack rolls**:
- **Close**: +1 (melee range, point-blank shooting)
- **Short**: +0 (optimal range for most weapons)
- **Medium**: -1 (standard engagement distance)
- **Long**: -2 (requires good aim and weapons)
- **Extreme**: -3 (specialist equipment needed)

## Cover & Concealment

### Cover System

Physical protection that increases Defense:

#### Light Cover (+1 Defense)
- **Examples**: Corner of wall, vehicle door, debris
- **Protection**: Partial body coverage
- **Weakness**: Vulnerable to flanking, area effects

#### Heavy Cover (+2 Defense)
- **Examples**: Solid wall, vehicle hull, reinforced position
- **Protection**: Most of body covered
- **Requirement**: Must be deliberately using cover

#### Superior Cover (+3 Defense)
- **Examples**: Bunker, turret, prepared fortification
- **Protection**: Nearly complete protection
- **Special**: Attackers need Awareness check (TN 14) to target

#### Total Cover (Cannot be targeted)
- **Examples**: Around corner, behind solid barrier
- **Protection**: Complete line-of-sight blockage
- **Limitation**: Cannot attack while in total cover

### Positioning Benefits

#### Elevation Advantage (+1 attack)
- **Requirement**: Attacking from higher position
- **Benefit**: Better angle of attack

#### Flanking (+1 attack)
- **Requirement**: Attacking from target's side/rear
- **Benefit**: Reduced effective cover

## Level Gap Balance Mechanics

### Minion Rules (5+ Level Difference)

When attacking opponents 5 or more levels below:

#### Minion Threshold
- **5-9 Level Gap**: Minions take double damage
- **10+ Level Gap**: Minions are defeated in one hit regardless of damage
- **Justification**: Represents vast skill and experience difference

#### Elite Opponents

Bosses and major opponents use **Elite Scaling**:
- **Elite Defense**: +Level bonus to Defense
- **Elite Resistance**: Immune to minion rules
- **Elite Actions**: May take additional actions per round

### Cross-Level Encounter Guidelines

#### Same Level Encounters
- Standard rules apply
- 85% hit rate for equal opponents
- Tactical positioning crucial

#### Minor Level Gaps (1-4 levels)
- Use standard rules
- Higher level character has advantage but not overwhelming

#### Major Level Gaps (5-9 levels)
- Minion rules apply to lower level opponents
- Multiple weak enemies vs one strong enemy

#### Extreme Level Gaps (10+ levels)
- Lower level opponents are effectively non-threats
- Use for dramatic moments or environmental hazards

---

## Special Maneuvers

### Core Tactical Actions

## Damage & Defense

### Damage Types
- **Kinetic**: Bullets, blades, mass drivers
- **Energy**: Lasers, plasma, particle beams
- **Electromagnetic**: EMP, ion weapons, system viruses
- **Exotic**: Quantum weapons, psionics, reality manipulation

### Status Effects in Combat

Status effects use three categories with three severity levels:

#### Physical Status
- **Impaired** (-2 to physical actions): Minor injuries, fatigue
- **Disabled** (Cannot take physical actions): Serious injury, restraints
- **Critical** (Ongoing crisis): Bleeding, burning, organ failure

#### Mental Status
- **Impaired** (-2 to mental actions): Confusion, minor stress
- **Disabled** (Cannot think clearly): Stunned, overwhelmed
- **Critical** (Mental breakdown): Panic, berserk rage, catatonic

#### System Status
- **Impaired** (-2 to electronic actions): Minor interference
- **Disabled** (Systems offline): Hacked, power loss, EMP
- **Critical** (Cascade failure): Progressive system failure

**Stacking Rules**: Different categories stack, same categories don't

## Design Philosophy

This balanced combat system achieves:

- **Consistent Challenge**: 85% hit rates maintained across all levels
- **Tactical Depth**: Positioning and cover matter more than pure numbers
- **Scalable Complexity**: Works for new players and veterans
- **Dramatic Pacing**: Faster resolution at higher levels
- **Player Agency**: Multiple valid approaches to every situation

The balanced formulas ensure that combat remains exciting and tactical from Level 1 through Level 20, preventing the "untouchable fighter" problem while maintaining meaningful character progression.
