# Environmental Hazards & Conditions

## Overview

Space is trying to kill you. From the vacuum of space to alien atmospheres, from radiation fields to gravitational anomalies, the environment itself poses constant threats. This system provides mechanical support for these hazards while maintaining the fast-paced nature of Cosmos Engine.

## Core Hazard Mechanics

### Hazard Structure
Every environmental hazard has:
- **Exposure Level**: How severe the hazard is
- **Save Type**: Which attribute defends against it
- **Save TN**: Difficulty to resist
- **Effect**: What happens on failure
- **Frequency**: How often saves are required

### Exposure Levels
1. **Minor**: Uncomfortable but manageable
2. **Moderate**: Dangerous without protection
3. **Major**: Lethal in minutes
4. **Extreme**: Lethal in rounds
5. **Instant**: Immediate death without protection

## ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDS

### Vacuum
The most common space hazard.

**Exposure Without Protection**:
- **Round 1**: Free action only, Might save TN 14 or Physical Impaired
- **Round 2**: Might save TN 17 or Physical Disabled
- **Round 3**: Might save TN 20 or fall to Critical health
- **Round 4+**: Automatic Defeated (death in realistic games)

**With Emergency Gear** (breath mask, emergency bubble):
- Extends survival to minutes instead of rounds
- -2 to all physical actions
- Equipment degrades rapidly

**With Proper Suit**:
- No immediate effects
- Limited by air supply (typically 2-8 hours)

### Toxic Atmosphere
Atmospheres hostile to your biology.

| Toxicity | Save TN | Frequency | Effect on Failure |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Mild | 11 | Per hour | Physical Impaired for scene |
| Moderate | 14 | Per 10 minutes | Physical Disabled for hour |
| Severe | 17 | Per minute | 1d10 damage + Disabled |
| Lethal | 20 | Per round | 2d10 damage + Critical |

**Protection**:
- Filter mask: +3 to saves
- Environment suit: Immunity to Moderate or less
- Species adaptation: May have natural immunity

### Pressure Extremes
Both high and low pressure environments.

**High Pressure** (deep ocean, gas giant):
- **2-3 atmospheres**: -1 to physical actions
- **4-10 atmospheres**: -2 to actions, Might save TN 14/hour or Physical Impaired
- **11+ atmospheres**: Might save TN 17/minute or 2d10 damage

**Low Pressure** (high altitude, thin atmosphere):
- **0.5-0.8 atmospheres**: -1 to extended physical actions
- **0.2-0.5 atmospheres**: Resolve save TN 14/hour or Mental Impaired
- **<0.2 atmospheres**: Treat as vacuum

## TEMPERATURE EXTREMES

### Extreme Cold

| Hot (40-60°C) | -1 after hour | No effect | No effect |
| Severe (60-100°C) | TN 14/hour | -1 after hour | No effect |
| Extreme (100-200°C) | TN 17/10 min | TN 14/hour | No effect |
| Inferno (>200°C) | TN 20/round | TN 17/minute | -1 to actions |

**Failed Save Effects**:
- First failure: Physical Impaired (heat exhaustion)
- Second failure: -2 to all actions (heat stroke)
- Third failure: Physical Disabled
- Fourth failure: Defeated (cooked)

**Equipment Effects**:
- Electronics: System Impaired in Extreme+
- Ammunition: May cook off (TN 14 per combat)
- Cooling systems: Drain power rapidly

## RADIATION

### Radiation Exposure
From solar flares to nuclear fallout.

| Level | Dose Rate | Save TN | Save Frequency | Effect |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Low | <1 rad/hr | 11 | Daily | Physical Impaired next day |
| Moderate | 1-10 rad/hr | 14 | Per hour | Physical Impaired + 1d6 damage |
| High | 10-100 rad/hr | 17 | Per 10 min | Physical Disabled + 2d6 damage |
| Severe | 100-1000 rad/hr | 20 | Per minute | System Critical + 3d6 damage |
| Lethal | >1000 rad/hr | 23 | Per round | Instant death (save for half) |

**Cumulative Effects**:
- Radiation damage doesn't heal naturally
- Multiple exposures stack
- Long-term: Lose 1 from random attribute per 100 rads

**Protection**:
- Basic shielding: -1 exposure level
- Radiation suit: -2 exposure levels
- Starship hull: -3 exposure levels
- Medical treatment: Anti-rad drugs grant +3 to saves

## GRAVITY ANOMALIES

### High Gravity
Worlds or areas with crushing gravity.

| Gravity | Effects | Save |
|---------|---------|------|
| 1.5g | -1 to physical actions, +1 falling damage | None |
| 2g | -2 to physical actions, double falling damage | Might TN 14/hour or Physical Impaired |
| 3g | -3 to physical actions, triple falling damage | Might TN 17/10 min or Physical Disabled |
| 4g+ | -4 to physical actions, ×4 falling damage | Might TN 20/minute or Critical |

**Long-term Exposure** (without augmentation):
- 1 week: Gain +1 Might (maximum 6)
- 1 month: Permanent -1 Coordination
- 1 year: Permanent health problems

### Low/Zero Gravity
Environments with reduced or no gravity.

**Zero-G Effects**:
- -2 to all physical actions until adapted (1-3 days)
- Movement requires handholds or thrusters
- Liquids form spheres, flames die without air flow
- No falling damage, but impacts still hurt

**Low Gravity** (0.1-0.5g):
- +1 to jumping/acrobatics
- -1 to melee damage
- Half normal falling damage
- Long-term: Lose 1 Might per month

**Adaptation**:
- Zero-G Training specialization negates penalties
- Magnetic boots provide stability
- Gene-mods or cybernetics can compensate
