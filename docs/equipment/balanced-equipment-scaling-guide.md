# Balanced Equipment Scaling Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the balanced equipment scaling system implemented to prevent number inflation while maintaining meaningful progression across technology eras. All equipment bonuses are capped at +3 to preserve tactical balance and ensure that character skill and positioning remain important throughout play.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Equipment enhances characters without replacing skill
- Technology progression provides options, not just bigger numbers
- Maximum +3 bonuses prevent inflation
- Meaningful tradeoffs at every tier
- Progression maintains tactical depth

## Technology Era Scaling

### Balanced Equipment Bonus Progression

| Technology Era | Equipment Bonus | Philosophy | Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| **Primitive** | +0 | Basic tools, no enhancement | Stone weapons, hide armor, manual tools |
| **Industrial** | +1 | Early manufacturing advantage | Firearms, steel armor, mechanical devices |
| **Advanced** | +2 | High-tech precision systems | Smart weapons, composite armor, electronics |
| **Stellar** | +3 | Peak technology enhancement | Energy weapons, powered armor, AI systems |

**Key Change**: Previous system had +0 to +6 scaling, causing excessive bonuses at high levels. New system caps at +3 for balance.

## Equipment Balance Verification

### Hit Rate Maintenance
With +3 maximum equipment bonuses, hit rates remain tactically relevant:

| Attacker Level | Equipment | vs Same Level | Hit Rate | Balance Status |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | +0 | Defense 13 | 85% | ✅ Balanced |
| 5 | +1 | Defense 15 | 85% | ✅ Balanced |
| 10 | +2 | Defense 17 | 85% | ✅ Balanced |
| 20 | +3 | Defense 20 | 85% | ✅ Balanced |

**Key Insight**: Equipment bonuses scale with character progression, maintaining consistent challenge.

### Cross-Level Balance
| High-Level Attacker | vs Low-Level Target | Hit Rate | Status |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Level 20 (+3 equip) | vs Level 5 | 95%+ | Expected dominance |
| Level 10 (+2 equip) | vs Level 1 | 90%+ | Clear advantage |
| Level 5 (+1 equip) | vs Level 1 | 90%+ | Moderate advantage |

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Equipment Updates
1. **Audit Current Bonuses**: Review all equipment for +4 or higher bonuses
2. **Rescale to +3 Maximum**: Redistribute bonuses across multiple features
3. **Add Tactical Tradeoffs**: Higher bonuses should come with meaningful costs
4. **Verify Balance**: Test against character progression examples

### For New Equipment Design
1. **Start with +0**: Base functionality with no bonuses
2. **Add Enhancement**: +1-3 based on technology level
3. **Include Tradeoffs**: Every bonus should have a corresponding limitation
4. **Consider Alternatives**: Multiple options at each tier with different strengths

### Technology Era Guidelines
- **Primitive (+0)**: Focus on reliability, availability, basic function
- **Industrial (+1)**: Mass production quality, standardization
- **Advanced (+2)**: Precision engineering, smart systems, specialization
- **Stellar (+3)**: Peak performance, AI integration, exotic materials

## Character Impact Analysis

### Skill vs Equipment Balance
| Level | Character Skill | Equipment Bonus | Balance |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | Low (+2) | Low (+0) | Equipment provides small boost |
| 5 | Medium (+3) | Medium (+1) | Skills dominate, equipment supports |
| 10 | High (+4) | High (+2) | Skills remain primary factor |
| 20 | Max (+5) | Max (+3) | Skills significantly outweigh equipment |

**Result**: Character development remains the primary progression mechanism.

### Progression Motivation
- **Early Game**: Equipment upgrades provide noticeable improvement
- **Mid Game**: Skill advancement becomes primary focus
- **Late Game**: Equipment provides specialized capabilities, not raw power
- **Endgame**: Legendary equipment offers unique abilities rather than just bonuses
