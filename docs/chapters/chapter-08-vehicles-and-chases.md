# Chapter 8: Vehicles and Chases

From motorcycles racing through neon-lit streets to starfighters dogfighting in asteroid fields, vehicles in Cosmos Engine are more than transportation—they're extensions of their pilots. The Universal Tag System transforms every vehicle into a unique character with personality, quirks, and synergies that create legendary pilot-machine partnerships.

## 8.1 Vehicles with Tags

### Understanding Vehicle Tags

Just as weapons and armor have tags, vehicles possess tags that define their personality, capabilities, and how they respond to different pilots. These tags interact with pilot skills, environmental conditions, and dramatic moments to create emergent gameplay.

**Performance Tags** - How the vehicle handles:

- Maya: "I use my [Local] knowledge with my [Custom] bike's [Lucky] nature to find a shortcut through the [Vertical] city!"
- Roll: 2d10 + 7 (Pilot) + 3 (bike handling) + 4 (tag synergies: Local+Urban+Fast+Lucky) = 24!
- She vanishes into a maintenance tunnel, opening two zones

**Round 2**:
