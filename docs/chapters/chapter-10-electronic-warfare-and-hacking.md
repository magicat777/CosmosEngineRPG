# Chapter 10: Electronic Warfare and Hacking

In an age of ubiquitous computing and networked systems, the digital battlefield is as important as physical space. This chapter covers hacking, cybersecurity, electronic warfare, and the tools that turn information into power across all scales of conflict.

## Hacking Fundamentals

### Digital Infiltration

Hacking represents the art of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, and digital infrastructure. Unlike simple Technology checks, hacking involves ongoing infiltration, stealth, and cyber-combat.

**Basic Hacking Process**:
1. **Target Identification**: Find systems to infiltrate
2. **Access Attempt**: Breach initial security
3. **Network Navigation**: Move through system zones
4. **Goal Achievement**: Complete objectives
5. **Extraction**: Escape without detection

### Core Mechanics

**Hacking Check**: 2d10 + Intellect + (Technology รท 2) + Equipment + Modifiers

**Network Zones**: Systems divided by security level
- **Public**: Open access (TN 8)
- **Secure**: Password protected (TN 11)
- **Admin**: Administrative access (TN 14)
- **Core**: Vital systems (TN 17)
- **Black**: Maximum security (TN 20)

**Time Scale**:
- Simple hack: Rounds (combat time)
- Complex infiltration: Minutes/Hours
- Long-term access: Days/Weeks

### Heat and Trace Systems

**Heat**: Represents detection risk
- Starts at 0, increases with actions
- Failed rolls add +2 Heat
- Aggressive actions add more Heat
- Reduces slowly over time

**Heat Thresholds**:
- 0-3: Undetected
- 4-6: Noticed (+2 TN)
- 7-9: Actively hunted (+4 TN)
- 10+: Full response (+6 TN, ICE deployment)

**Trace**: Active pursuit by security
