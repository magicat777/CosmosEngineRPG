# Chapter 5: Actions and Skills

Skills represent your character's training, experience, and expertise in various fields. In Cosmos Engine, skills operate on a **10-rank progression system** that scales seamlessly from personal actions to commanding galactic fleets. Each skill advancement grants not only mechanical benefits but also **narrative tags** that define *how* your abilities manifest, creating rich character differentiation and story hooks.

## 5.1 Understanding the Tag System

### What Are Tags?

Tags are descriptive keywords that explain *how* your character approaches tasks. They provide:
- **Mechanical bonuses** when circumstances match (+1 to +5 dice)
- **Story hooks** for GMs to create compelling scenarios
- **Character differentiation** - same skills, completely different characters
- **Equipment synergies** - your tags interact with gear tags
- **Evolution potential** - tags grow and change through play

### How Tags Work

Every rank in a skill grants you a new tag that describes your approach:
- **Rank 1-3**: Foundation tags - basic approaches and styles
- **Rank 4-5**: Professional tags - specialized techniques
- **Rank 6-7**: Master tags - exceptional abilities
- **Rank 8-9**: Legendary tags - reality-bending approaches
- **Rank 10**: Archetype tags - you embody the skill itself

### Tag Synergies

When your character tags match equipment or environmental tags, you gain bonus dice:
- **2 matching tags**: +1 die (Basic Synergy)
- **3 matching tags**: +2 dice (Strong Synergy)
- **4 matching tags**: +3 dice (Perfect Synergy)
- **5+ matching tags**: +4 to +5 dice (Legendary Synergy)

**Example**: Sarah has Combat [Precise] and uses an [Accurate] rifle in a [Stable] firing position = +2 dice from three matching precision-themed tags.

## 5.2 Using Skills

### Basic Skill Resolution

The core mechanic remains elegantly simple:

**Basic Skill Check**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill Rank + Tag Bonuses + Modifiers vs Target Number

When attempting a task:
1. GM determines which skill applies
2. Player chooses appropriate attribute pairing
3. Player describes action using their tags
4. GM sets Target Number based on difficulty
5. Roll dice and compare to TN
6. Apply consequences based on success/failure

### Attribute Pairings

Most skills have a primary attribute but can pair with others for specific applications:

**Combat Examples**:
- **Combat + Might**: Melee attacks, breaking objects
- **Combat + Coordination**: Ranged attacks, quick draws
- **Combat + Awareness**: Tactical assessment, ambush detection
- **Combat + Intellect**: Analyzing fighting styles, planning battles

The GM determines which pairing fits, or players can suggest creative applications.

### Scale Integration

Skills work consistently across all scales:
- **Personal Scale** (Ranks 1-3): Individual actions
- **Vehicle Scale** (Ranks 4-5): Vehicle operations
- **Starship Scale** (Ranks 6-7): Capital ship command
- **Fleet Scale** (Ranks 8-10): Galactic operations

Your tags evolve in scope as you advance - [Precise] might mean "careful shot placement" at Rank 1 but "surgical orbital bombardment" at Rank 8.

## 5.4 Skill Advancement

### Gaining Ranks

Skills advance through Advancement Points (AP) earned during play:
- **Session rewards**: 1-3 AP for participation
- **Achievement rewards**: 1-5 AP for major accomplishments  
- **Synergy discovery**: 1-3 AP for finding new tag combinations
- **Character moments**: 1-2 AP for exceptional roleplay

### Advancement Costs (Fibonacci Progression)

| Current Rank | Next Rank | AP Cost |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 4 | 5 | 8 |
| 5 | 6 | 13 |
| 6 | 7 | 21 |
| 7 | 8 | 34 |
| 8 | 9 | 55 |
| 9 | 10 | 89 |

### Tag Selection

When gaining a new rank:
1. Review the four tag options for that rank
2. Consider your character concept and playstyle
3. Think about potential synergies with existing tags
4. Choose one tag that best fits your vision
5. Document how the tag manifests for your character

## 5.5 Tag Synergy Reference

### Common Synergy Types

**Style Synergies** (How you do things):
- [Precise] + [Patient] = Perfect timing
- [Aggressive] + [Brutal] = Overwhelming force
- [Subtle] + [Clever] = Misdirection mastery

**Source Synergies** (Where power comes from):
- [Enhanced] + [Digital] = Cybernetic fusion
- [Trained] + [Disciplined] = Perfect technique
- [Natural] + [Evolved] = Next-stage human

**Scale Synergies** (Matching scope):
- Personal tag + Personal equipment = Basic synergy
- Vehicle tag + Vehicle systems = Enhanced control
- Ship tag + Ship equipment = Total integration

### Creating Synergy Webs

Advanced characters develop "synergy webs" where multiple skills interconnect:

**Example: The Digital Warrior**
- Combat [Enhanced] + [Digital]
- Technology [Cyber-Warrior] + [System-Lord]  
- Perception [Tech-Enhanced] + [Data-Stream]
- Result: Can fight through any networked system

### Discovering New Synergies

Players discover synergies through:
1. **Creative description** of actions using multiple tags
2. **Experimentation** with different combinations
3. **Story moments** where tags naturally combine
4. **Equipment matches** when gear tags align with skills

GMs should reward creative synergy use with bonus dice and AP.

## 5.6 Skill Use Examples

### Multi-Skill Challenges

Complex tasks often require multiple skills:

**Infiltrating Secure Facility**:
- Stealth for physical infiltration
- Technology for security systems
- Deception for social engineering
- Athletics for emergency escape

**Starship Battle**:
- Pilot for maneuvering
- Combat for weapons
- Technology for systems
- Command for crew coordination

### Skill Substitution

Sometimes players can justify using unexpected skills:
- Intimidation instead of Persuasion (fear vs charm)
- Technology instead of Medical (cybernetic treatment)
- Knowledge instead of Perception (knowing where to look)

GM discretion applies, usually with increased difficulty.

### Group Skill Checks

When working together:
1. Determine lead character (highest skill)
2. Others with relevant skills can assist
3. Each assistant with matching tags adds +1
4. Maximum assist bonus equals lead character's skill rank
