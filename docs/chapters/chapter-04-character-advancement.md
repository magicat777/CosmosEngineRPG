## Power Scaling Guidelines

### Maintaining Balance

As characters advance, consider:

**Lateral Growth**: Breadth over height
- Encourage diverse skills
- Reward versatility
- Create varied challenges

**Narrative Weight**: Power requires responsibility
- Higher skills attract attention
- Enemies scale with heroes
- Actions have wider consequences

**Resource Management**: Power has costs
- Advanced equipment needs maintenance
- Specializations require practice
- Allies need reciprocal support

### Power Differences

When characters have different advancement levels:

**Spotlight Sharing**: Everyone contributes
- Design challenges for all levels
- Create specialist moments
- Use scale differences creatively

**Mentorship**: Experienced help novices
- Teaching grants small AP rewards
- Creates character bonds
- Maintains group cohesion

**Differential Advancement**: Balance over time
- Newer characters advance faster initially
- Veterans gain other benefits (contacts, resources)
- Focus on different advancement types

## Advancement Example

**Sarah's character Zara after 10 sessions**:

Starting: Pilot 5, Combat 3, Tech 2
Earned: 25 AP (10 sessions + milestones)

Spending:
- Combat 3→4: 40 AP (saved 15 AP from creation)
- Basic Specialization "Ace Pilot": 50 AP (saved)
- Remaining: 0 AP

Zara can now reroll failed Pilot checks once per scene and has improved her combat abilities. Sarah plans to save for advancing Tech next, wanting to maintain her own ship.

## Quick Advancement Option

For faster progression:
- Double all AP awards
- Reduce all AP costs by 25%
- Allow attribute advancement every 6 months
- Start with one Basic specialization free

This creates more superheroic characters rising quickly to cosmic challenges.
