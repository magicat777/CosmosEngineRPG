## 4.3 Tag Synergy System

### Understanding Tag Synergies

When character tags align with equipment, environment, or team members, bonus dice accumulate:

**Basic Synergy (2 matching tags)**: +1 die
- [Precise] character + [Accurate] weapon
- [Enhanced] pilot + [Advanced] ship

**Strong Synergy (3 matching tags)**: +2 dice
- [Military] + [Disciplined] character + [Veteran] unit
- [Digital] + [Quantum] hacker + [AI] assistant

**Perfect Synergy (4+ matching tags)**: +3 to +5 dice
- [Legendary] + [Inspiring] + [Tactical] + [Veteran] commander leading [Elite] troops in [Decisive] battle
- Reality bends to accommodate such perfect alignment

### Synergy Discovery Process

**Experimental Discovery**: During play, players propose new combinations:
1. **Describe** how tags might work together narratively
2. **Make the roll** with proposed bonus dice
3. **GM evaluates** if synergy works and power level
4. **Success** establishes synergy for future use
5. **Document** in campaign synergy log

**Discovery Rewards**:
- **First Discovery**: 1 AP bonus
- **Perfect Synergy**: 2 AP bonus
