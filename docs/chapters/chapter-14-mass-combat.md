# Chapter 14: Mass Combat

When armies clash and fleets engage across star systems, more than tactics and numbers determine victoryâ€”the soul of each force shapes the battlefield. The Universal Tag System transforms mass combat from abstract unit management into epic narratives where legendary regiments, cursed battalions, and awakened fleets create history through their personalities and bonds.
