- Might 3, Resolve 4: 40 + 24 + 16 = 80 HP
- Might 5, Resolve 5: 40 + 40 + 20 = 100 HP

### Defense Values (Balanced System)

**Physical Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Armor
- Base examples (Combat 3, no cover/armor):
  - Coordination 3: 10 + 3 + 2 = 15 Defense
  - Coordination 5: 10 + 5 + 2 = 17 Defense  
  - Coordination 7: 10 + 7 + 2 = 19 Defense

## Character Creation Example

**Sarah creates Zara Chen, a pilot:**

**Concept**: Former military pilot who discovered her squadron was transporting kidnapped colonists. Went AWOL, now flies for whoever opposes the corrupt military-industrial complex.

**Species**: Synaptic - Her enhanced reflexes and quick thinking made her an ace pilot, though her small stature sometimes causes others to underestimate her.

- Might: 3 (0 points, -2 from species = 1)
- Coordination: 5 (4 points, +2 from species = 7)
- Awareness: 6 (7 points)
- Intellect: 5 (4 points, +1 from species = 6)
- Resolve: 5 (4 points, -1 from species = 4)

- Defense: 10 + 7 + (3÷2) + 1 (size) = 19 (high due to combat training)
- Speed: 6 + 7 = 13 meters (very fast)
- Initiative: 7 + 6 + 1d10 = 13-23 (excellent reflexes)
- Attack (Ranged): 2d10 + 7 + (3÷2) = 2d10 + 9
- Damage (Autopistol): 1d8 + (3÷2) = 1d8 + 2

**Species Abilities**:
- Size provides +1 Defense
- +2 Initiative from enhanced reflexes
- Can take one extra Quick action per round
