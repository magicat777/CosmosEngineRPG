## Step 5: Select Initial Tags

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are narrative descriptors that define *how* your skills manifest. Each skill rank grants one tag that creates unique character differentiation even among characters with identical mechanical skills.

### Tag Selection Process

For each skill rank you possess, select **one tag** from the available options for that skill and rank:

**Rank 1 Tags**: Choose foundational approach from 4 options
**Rank 2 Tags**: Choose style refinement from 4 options  
**Rank 3 Tags**: Choose specialization focus from 4 options

### Tag Categories

**Style Tags** - How you approach tasks:
- [Precise]: Surgical accuracy, measured approach
- [Brutal]: Overwhelming force, intimidating presence
- [Subtle]: Hidden action, misdirection
- [Aggressive]: Forward momentum, taking initiative

**Source Tags** - Where abilities come from:
- [Enhanced]: Technological augmentation

### Tag Manifestation Documentation

For each tag, document:
- **Source**: How you gained this approach
- **Manifestation**: How it appears in the world
- **Weakness**: When it doesn't work
- **Personality**: How it affects your behavior

**Example Tag Documentation**:
```

### Tag Synergy Planning

Consider how your tags might work together:

**Perfect Synergies** (+3 dice):
- [Enhanced] + [Digital] = "Cyber-Fusion" - Technology integration
- [Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect Moment" - Time manipulation
- [Social] + [Leadership] = "Natural Authority" - Instinctive following

**Strong Synergies** (+2 dice):
- [Enhanced] + [Trained] = "Optimized Performance" - Tech meets skill
- [Tactical] + [Technical] = "Systems Optimization" - Maximum efficiency

## Step 6: Calculate Derived Values

### Hit Points
**Formula**: 40 + (Might × 8) + (Resolve × 4)

**Examples**:
- Might 3, Resolve 4: 40 + 24 + 16 = 80 HP
- Might 5, Resolve 5: 40 + 40 + 20 = 100 HP
- Might 6, Resolve 3: 40 + 48 + 12 = 100 HP

### Health States
- **Healthy** (100-75%): No penalties
- **Wounded** (74-50%): -1 to all actions
- **Injured** (49-25%): -2 to all actions
- **Critical** (24-1%): -3 to all actions
- **Dying** (0 or less): Unconscious, requires immediate aid

### Defense Values (Balanced System)

**Physical Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Armor
- Base examples (Combat 3, no cover/armor):
  - Coordination 3: 10 + 3 + 2 = 15 Defense
  - Coordination 5: 10 + 5 + 2 = 17 Defense  
  - Coordination 7: 10 + 7 + 2 = 19 Defense
- Combat training improves defense as well as offense
- Cover (+1 to +3) and armor (+1 to +3) provide additional protection

**Mental Defense**: 10 + Resolve + (Intellect ÷ 2)
- Used against mental attacks, fear, and manipulation

**Electronic Defense**: 10 + Intellect + Systems Rating
- Used against hacking, EMP, and electronic warfare

### Movement

**Base Speed**: 5 + Coordination meters per move action
- Coordination 3: 8 meters
- Coordination 5: 10 meters
- Coordination 7: 12 meters

**Full Move**: Double speed but no other actions
**Sprint**: Triple speed, straight line only, -2 Defense

### Initiative
**Formula**: Coordination + Awareness + 1d10 (rolled each combat)

### Saving Throws
Based on attributes:
- **Might Save**: 2d10 + Might vs TN
- **Coordination Save**: 2d10 + Coordination vs TN
- **Awareness Save**: 2d10 + Awareness vs TN
- **Intellect Save**: 2d10 + Intellect vs TN
- **Resolve Save**: 2d10 + Resolve vs TN
- **Presence Save**: 2d10 + Presence vs TN

## Step 7: Purchase Equipment
