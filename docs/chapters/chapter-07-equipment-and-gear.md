# Chapter 7: Equipment and Gear

Equipment in Cosmos Engine spans from primitive tools to reality-bending technology. More than just numbers and bonuses, every piece of equipment possesses **tags** that define its personality, capabilities, and how it interacts with character abilities. Your gear grows with you, developing new traits through use and becoming as unique as your character.

## 7.1 The Equipment Tag System

### Understanding Equipment Tags

Just as characters have skill tags that describe *how* they act, equipment has tags that describe *what* it enables and *how* it behaves. These tags:
- Create **synergies** with character tags (+1 to +5 dice)
- **Evolve** through use and story
- Define equipment **personality** and quirks
- Enable **emergent gameplay** through combinations

### Tag Categories for Equipment

**Quality Tags** - Construction level:
- **[Basic]**: Standard functionality, reliable
- **[Superior]**: Enhanced performance, durable
- **[Masterwork]**: Exceptional craft, prestigious
- **[Legendary]**: Unique history, famous

**Damage Type Tags** - How it harms:
- **[Kinetic]**: Physical projectiles, bullets
- **[Energy]**: Lasers, plasma, particle beams
- **[Explosive]**: Area damage, concussive force
- **[Exotic]**: Unusual damage (psionic, dimensional)

**Combat Style Tags** - Tactical application:
- **[Accurate]**: Enhanced hit probability
- **[Rapid]**: Multiple attacks capability
- **[Heavy]**: High damage, slower use
- **[Silent]**: Minimal noise signature

**Special Property Tags** - Unique features:
- **[Smart]**: Adapts to user preferences
- **[Living]**: Biological components
- **[Quantum]**: Probability manipulation
- **[Cursed]**: Powerful but dangerous

### Equipment Evolution

Equipment gains tags through:
- **Use** (10+ sessions): Develop personality tags
- **Story Events**: Gain reputation or history tags
- **Modification**: Add functional tags
- **Bonding**: Create user-specific tags

### Tag Limits by Tech Level

Technology level determines maximum tags:
- **Primitive Era**: 1 tag maximum
- **Industrial Era**: 2 tags maximum
- **Advanced Era**: 3 tags maximum
- **Stellar Era**: 4 tags maximum
- **Cosmic Era**: 5-6 tags maximum
