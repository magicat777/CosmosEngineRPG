# Chapter 11: Running Cosmos Engine

As Game Master, you orchestrate a living universe where every element—from characters to starships to military units—possesses personality through tags. The Universal Tag System transforms your role from rules arbiter to curator of emergent narratives where player creativity, equipment evolution, and perfect synergies create legendary moments.

## 11.1 Mastering the Tag System

### The GM's Tag Philosophy

Tags are more than mechanical bonuses—they're narrative DNA that shapes every interaction. Your role is to:

**Encourage Discovery**: Players will find unexpected tag combinations
**Reward Creativity**: Novel tag uses deserve recognition
**Embrace Emergence**: Let tags reshape your world
**Track Evolution**: Document how tags grow through play
**Create Opportunities**: Design scenes that spotlight different tags

### Core Tag Principles

**Tags Tell Stories**: Every tag suggests narrative possibilities
- [Enhanced] isn't just +1 to rolls—it's corporate tracking, upgrade needs, and identity questions
- [Lucky] isn't just rerolls—it's impossible coincidences, jealous rivals, and fate's attention
- [Veteran] isn't just experience—it's old wounds, past enemies, and hard-won wisdom

**Tags Have Costs**: Power comes with complications
- [Digital] mastery means vulnerability to EMP
- [Brutal] effectiveness means social consequences  
- [Enhanced] abilities mean maintenance needs
- [Psionic] powers mean mental strain

**Tags Create Connections**: Synergies build relationships
- Characters bond over shared tags
- Equipment becomes meaningful through tags
- Locations favor certain tags
- Entire campaigns emerge from tag interactions

### When to Award Tag Bonuses

**Perfect Synergy (4-5 matching tags)**: +3 to +5 dice
- Situation ideally crafted for these tags
- Multiple elements align perfectly
- Creates legendary moments
- Example: [Sniper] + [Patient] + [Precise] weapon + [Stable] position + [Clear] conditions

**Strong Synergy (3 matching tags)**: +2 dice
- Clear thematic alignment
- Character approach matches situation
- Example: [Hacker] + [Digital] environment + [Quantum] computer

**Basic Synergy (2 matching tags)**: +1 die
- Simple tag alignment
- Standard advantage
- Example: [Strong] character + [Heavy] weapon

**No Bonus**: Tags don't apply or cancel out
- Wrong tool for the job
- Environmental opposition
- Example: [Digital] expert in primitive society

**Penalty**: Tags actively hinder
- Direct opposition to approach
- Environmental hostility
- Example: [Enhanced] in anti-tech field (-1 to -3 dice)

## 11.2 Tag Management Tools

### The Tag Tracker

Keep a campaign journal of tag evolution:

```
CHARACTER: Maya Chen
Starting Tags: [Digital] [Patient] [Perfectionist]

Session 5: Discovered [Digital] + [Patient] = "Ghost Protocol" (leaves no trace)
Session 8: Equipment synergy: [Perfectionist] + [Precision] rifle = "One Shot"
Session 12: Complication: [Digital] dependency caused withdrawal (-2 dice)
Session 15: Evolution: [Digital] → [Quantum Hacker] after consciousness upload
Session 20: Cross-character: [Digital] + Jin's [Lucky] = "Probability Hack"
```

### Tag Evolution Milestones
