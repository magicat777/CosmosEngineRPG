Combat in Cosmos Engine is fast, deadly, and tactical. The Universal Tag System transforms every fight into a dynamic narrative where character abilities, weapon properties, and environmental conditions create emergent gameplay. Your combat tags don't just provide bonuses—they define *how* you fight, creating cinematic moments and tactical depth.
