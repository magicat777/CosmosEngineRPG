# Chapter 6: Personal Combat

Combat in Cosmos Engine is fast, deadly, and tactical. The Universal Tag System transforms every fight into a dynamic narrative where character abilities, weapon properties, and environmental conditions create emergent gameplay. Your combat tags don't just provide bonuses—they define *how* you fight, creating cinematic moments and tactical depth.

## 6.1 Combat with Tags

### Understanding Combat Tags

Combat is where the tag system truly shines. Every element—your character's fighting style, your weapon's properties, the environment, even your emotional state—uses tags that interact to create unique combat experiences.

**Character Combat Tags** describe your fighting approach:
- **[Precise]**: Careful shot placement, surgical strikes
- **[Brutal]**: Overwhelming force, intimidation through violence
- **[Defensive]**: Protection-focused, counter-fighting
- **[Aggressive]**: Relentless assault, pressure tactics
- **[Tactical]**: Battlefield control, exploiting weaknesses

**Weapon Tags** define equipment behavior:
- **[Accurate]**: Enhanced hit probability
- **[Heavy]**: High damage, slower use
- **[Rapid]**: Multiple attack capability
- **[Silent]**: Minimal noise signature
- **[Devastating]**: Extreme damage potential

**Environmental Tags** create battlefield dynamics:
- **[Confined]**: Close quarters favor melee
- **[Elevated]**: High ground provides advantage
- **[Unstable]**: Shifting terrain disrupts movement
