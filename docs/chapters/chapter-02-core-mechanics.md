# Chapter 2: Core Mechanics

## The 2d10 System

At the heart of Cosmos Engine lies a simple, unified resolution mechanic:

**Basic Roll**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers + Tag Bonuses vs Target Number (TN)

When you attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the GM sets a Target Number based on the task's difficulty. You roll two ten-sided dice, add your relevant attribute and skill, apply any situational modifiers, and compare the total to the TN. Equal or exceed it, and you succeed. Fall short, and you fail.

### Reading the Dice

When you roll 2d10, you add both dice together for a result from 2 to 20. The probability curve means results cluster around 11, making average tasks achievable for competent characters while preserving dramatic swings for critical moments.

**Special Rolls**:
- **Natural 20** (two 10s): Critical Success
- **Natural 2** (two 1s): Critical Failure
- **Doubles**: Extreme results (very good or very bad)

## Attributes (PRIMAC)

Every character possesses six primary attributes rated from 1 to 10:

### Presence (PRE)
Your force of personality, leadership capability, and social impact. Presence measures how well you influence others, project confidence, and navigate social situations.
- **Key Uses**: Leadership, persuasion, intimidation, performance
- **Saving Throw**: Resist social manipulation, maintain composure

### Resolve (RES)
Your mental fortitude, willpower, and determination. Resolve represents your ability to persevere through adversity and maintain focus under pressure.
- **Key Uses**: Concentration, resistance to fear, mental endurance
- **Saving Throw**: Resist mental effects, maintain sanity

### Intellect (INT)
Your reasoning ability, memory, and analytical thinking. Intellect measures how quickly you learn, solve problems, and understand complex concepts.
- **Key Uses**: Investigation, technology, medicine, tactics
- **Saving Throw**: Recognize illusions, solve puzzles quickly

### Might (MIG)
Your physical strength and power. Might determines how much you can lift, how hard you hit, and your raw physical presence.
- **Key Uses**: Melee combat, lifting, breaking objects, athletics
- **Saving Throw**: Resist physical effects, break free from restraints

### Awareness (AWA)
Your perception, intuition, and connection to your surroundings. Awareness helps you notice details, react quickly, and sense danger.
- **Key Uses**: Initiative, perception, ranged combat, piloting
- **Saving Throw**: Avoid surprise, detect ambushes

### Coordination (COO)
Your agility, dexterity, and precise motor control. Coordination affects your accuracy, balance, and ability to perform delicate tasks.
- **Key Uses**: Ranged attacks, defense, stealth, technical work
- **Saving Throw**: Avoid physical hazards, maintain balance

### Attribute Scale

**1-3**: Below Average - Deficiency in this area
**4-5**: Average - Normal human capability
**6-7**: Above Average - Natural talent
**8-9**: Exceptional - Among the best
**10**: Legendary - Peak human ability

### Using Attributes

Attributes provide the foundation for all actions:
- **Attribute Only**: For raw, untrained efforts (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **With Skills**: Combined with training (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs TN)
- **Saving Throws**: Reactive defense (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **Contests**: Opposed rolls (highest total wins)

## Skills Overview

Skills represent specialized training and experience. Unlike attributes, skills start at 0 and improve through advancement points.

### Skill Progression (10 Ranks, 7 Tiers)
- **Rank 1**: Apprentice-I (Basic competency)
- **Rank 2**: Apprentice-II (Developing expertise)
- **Rank 3**: Journeyman-I (Professional level)
- **Ranks 4-5**: Journeyman-II (Exceptional ability)
- **Ranks 6-7**: Master-I (Sector-renowned)
- **Ranks 8-9**: Master-II (Legendary mastery)
- **Rank 10**: Grandmaster (Reality-defining)

Each skill rank grants one **tag** that describes how your abilities manifest, creating unique character differentiation and cross-skill synergies.

### Core Skills

**Combat** (Might or Coordination): Armed and unarmed fighting
**Pilot** (Awareness or Coordination): Vehicle and starship operation
**Tech** (Intellect): Computers, electronics, and engineering
**Social** (Presence): Persuasion, deception, and etiquette
**Survival** (Awareness or Resolve): Endurance and wilderness skills
**Stealth** (Coordination): Moving unseen and unheard
**Medicine** (Intellect): Healing and biological sciences
**Investigation** (Intellect or Awareness): Research and deduction

## Tags and Synergies

### What Are Tags?

**Tags** are narrative descriptors that define *how* your skills manifest in the world. They provide both mechanical benefits and rich storytelling opportunities:

- **Mechanical Bonuses**: +1 to +5 dice when circumstances match your tags
- **Character Differentiation**: Same skills, completely different characters through tags
- **Story Hooks**: Pre-built complications and spotlight moments for GMs
- **Cross-Skill Synergies**: Tags from different skills combine for emergent effects

### Tag Categories

**Style Tags** - How you approach tasks:
- [Precise]: Surgical accuracy, measured approach
- [Brutal]: Overwhelming force, intimidating presence
- [Subtle]: Hidden action, misdirection
- [Aggressive]: Forward momentum, taking initiative

**Source Tags** - Where abilities come from:
- [Enhanced]: Technological augmentation
- [Trained]: Dedicated learning and practice
- [Innate]: Natural talent or genetic gift
- [Experimental]: Untested methods or prototypes

**Domain Tags** - What your skills affect:
- [Digital]: Computer systems, networks, data
- [Social]: Interpersonal, cultural, emotional
- [Environmental]: Natural world, survival, adaptation
- [Mechanical]: Physical devices, engineering

### Tag Bonuses in Resolution

Tags modify dice rolls when circumstances align with your character's approach:

**Tag Bonus Formula**: +1 to +5 dice based on narrative fit
- **Perfect Match** (+3 dice): Circumstances ideal for your tag
- **Strong Match** (+2 dice): Tag clearly applies to situation
- **Partial Match** (+1 die): Tag tangentially relevant

**Example**: Marcus has Combat [Enhanced] from neural targeting implants
- In full daylight with clear sight lines: +3 dice (perfect conditions for targeting system)
- During normal combat: +2 dice (enhanced reflexes help)
- In EMP-affected area: +0 dice (implants non-functional)

### Synergy System

When tags from different skills work together, they create **synergies**:

**Perfect Synergy** (+3 dice):
- [Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect Moment" - Time seems to slow for ideal timing
- [Digital] + [Technical] = "Technomancy" - Technology bends to your will

**Strong Synergy** (+2 dice):
- [Enhanced] + [Trained] = "Optimized Performance" - Augmentation meets discipline
- [Social] + [Leadership] = "Natural Authority" - People instinctively follow

**Basic Synergy** (+1 die):
- Compatible tags that complement without conflict
- Minor coordination benefits

**Tag Conflicts** (-1 to -2 dice):
- [Brutal] vs [Subtle] = Must choose force or finesse
- [Reckless] vs [Patient] = Internal tension between approaches

### Tag Usage Guidelines

**Per Scene Limits**:
- **Perfect Synergies**: Once per scene free, then costs 1 Advancement Point
- **Strong/Basic Synergies**: Always available when applicable
- **Multiple Tags**: Maximum +5 dice total from all tag sources

**GM Discretion**: Tags require narrative justification - players must describe how tags apply to receive bonuses.

## Basic Task Resolution

### Setting Target Numbers

The GM sets Target Numbers based on task difficulty:

| Difficulty | TN | Example |
|------------|----|---------| 
| Trivial | 8 | Notice something obvious |
| Easy | 11 | Pick a simple lock |
| Moderate | 14 | Pilot through debris field |
| Hard | 17 | Hack military encryption |
| Extreme | 20 | Perform emergency surgery in zero-g |
| Legendary | 23 | Outsmart an AI |
| Impossible | 26 | Bend reality through will alone |

### Tag-Enhanced Resolution Process

1. **Player Declares Intent**: "I want to hack into the security system"
2. **GM Sets Difficulty**: "That's a Hard task, TN 17"
3. **Determine Attribute + Skill**: Intellect + Tech
4. **Apply Modifiers**: +2 for specialized tools
5. **Identify Applicable Tags**: Tech [Digital] + Stealth [Patient] = "Ghost Protocol" synergy
6. **Apply Tag Bonuses**: +3 dice for Perfect Synergy (invisible electronic infiltration)
7. **Roll Dice Pool**: 2d10 + 3 bonus dice = Roll 5 dice, use best 2
8. **Dice Results**: Best two dice: 8 and 7 = 15
9. **Calculate Total**: 15 + 6 (INT) + 4 (Tech) + 2 (tools) = 27
10. **Compare to TN**: 27 vs 17 = Success by 10 (Legendary Success!)

### Margins of Success and Failure

The difference between your result and the TN determines the degree of success or failure:

**Success Margins**:
- **0-2**: Marginal Success - You barely succeed
- **3-5**: Solid Success - Clear accomplishment  
- **6-9**: Critical Success - Exceptional result
- **10+**: Legendary Success - Perfect execution

**Failure Margins**:
- **1-2**: Marginal Failure - Almost succeeded
- **3-5**: Clear Failure - Definitely didn't work
- **6-9**: Critical Failure - Things go wrong
- **10+**: Catastrophic Failure - Disaster strikes

## Dice Pool Modifiers

### Tag Bonuses (Primary Modifier)
**Bonus Dice**: Add dice to your pool based on applicable tags:
- **Perfect Match**: +3 dice
- **Strong Match**: +2 dice  
- **Partial Match**: +1 die
- **Synergy Bonus**: +1 to +3 additional dice
- **Maximum Total**: +5 dice from all tag sources

### Advantage & Disadvantage (Secondary Modifiers)
When circumstances beyond tags affect difficulty:

**Advantage** - Roll 3d10 and use the best two dice:
- Superior equipment beyond character tags
- Assistance from others
- Exceptionally ideal conditions
- Spending significant resources

**Disadvantage** - Roll 3d10 and use the worst two dice:
- Inferior tools or broken equipment
- Severe environmental hazards
- Major distractions or interference
- Working under extreme pressure

### Combining Modifiers
**Priority Order**:
1. **Tag Bonuses**: Always apply first (up to +5 dice total)
2. **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Applies to final dice pool
3. **Static Bonuses**: Equipment, assistance (+1 to +3 to result)

**Example**: Character with +3 tag bonus dice and Advantage
- Base: 2d10
- Tags: +3 dice = 5d10 total
- Advantage: Roll 6d10, use best 2 dice
- Final: 2 dice + static bonuses vs TN

## Critical Success & Failure

### Critical Success (Natural 20)
When you roll two 10s:
- Automatic success regardless of TN
- Maximum possible effect
- Additional beneficial outcome
- Possible permanent advantage

**Examples**:
- Combat: Maximum damage + special effect
- Social: NPC becomes lasting ally
- Tech: Permanent system access gained
- Pilot: Impossible maneuver achieved

### Critical Failure (Natural 2)
When you roll two 1s:
- Automatic failure regardless of modifiers
- Complication introduced
- Possible equipment damage
- Temporary disadvantage

**Examples**:
- Combat: Weapon jams or breaks
- Social: Major faux pas, reputation damaged
- Tech: System locks you out permanently
- Pilot: Minor collision or system failure

## Time and Actions

### Time Scales

Cosmos Engine uses flexible time scales:

**Narrative Time**: For exploration and roleplay
- No formal tracking
- Actions take realistic time
- GM describes passage of time

**Scene Time**: For dramatic situations
- Roughly 10-30 minutes game time
- Multiple actions per character
- Used for investigations, social encounters

**Round Time**: For combat and action scenes
- 6 seconds per round
- Formal initiative order
- Specific action economy

### Action Types

During round time, each character can take:

**1 Standard Action**:
- Make an attack
- Full skill use
- Complex maneuver

**1 Move Action**:
- Move your Speed in meters
- Stand from prone
- Draw/sheathe weapon

**Unlimited Quick Actions**:
- Speak
- Drop an item
- Simple gestures

**Unlimited Free Actions**:
- Maintain concentration
- Observe surroundings

## Scale System

Cosmos Engine uses four interconnected scales with **tag evolution** across each:

### Personal Scale (Ranks 1-2)
Individual characters taking individual actions:
- Base scale for all mechanics
- 1 meter = 1 meter
- 1 round = 6 seconds
- **Tags**: Represent individual abilities and approaches
- **Tag Scope**: Limited to personal actions

### Vehicle Scale (Rank 3)
Ground and air vehicles:
- 10 meters = 1 vehicle unit
- Same time scale as personal
- Vehicle weapons vs people: +6 damage
- **Tags**: Expand to affect small teams and vehicles
- **Tag Scope**: Begin influencing others through leadership or example

### Starship Scale (Ranks 4-7)
Spacecraft and space stations:
- 1 kilometer = 1 space unit
- Same 6-second rounds
- Starship weapons vs vehicles: +6 damage
- **Tags**: Affect entire ship crews and operations
- **Tag Scope**: Reputation precedes character, influence organizations

### Fleet Scale (Ranks 8-10)
Military units and fleet battles:
- Abstract unit representation
- 10-minute battle rounds
- Strategic rather than tactical
- **Tags**: Reshape entire theaters of operation
- **Tag Scope**: Personal abilities scale to galactic significance

### Cross-Scale Interactions

**Scale Difference Penalties**:
- 1 scale difference: -3 to hit
- 2 scale differences: -6 to hit
- 3 scale differences: Generally impossible

**Damage Scaling**:
- Higher scale to lower: +6 damage per scale
- Lower scale to higher: -6 damage per scale

**Tag Evolution Across Scales**:
As characters advance in rank, their tags evolve to work at higher scales:

**Example - Combat [Enhanced] Tag**:
- **Rank 1** (Personal): "Neural targeting implant provides HUD overlay"
- **Rank 3** (Vehicle): "Squad coordination through shared neural link"
- **Rank 6** (Starship): "Ship crew neural network enables perfect timing"
- **Rank 10** (Fleet): "Fleet-wide tactical consciousness transcends distance"

**Cross-Scale Tag Applications**:
- **Lower Scale → Higher**: Tags provide +1 die when attempting actions above your scale
- **Higher Scale → Lower**: Tags provide +2 dice when working at scales below your capability
- **Same Scale**: Full tag bonuses apply normally

**Scale-Specific Synergies**:
Some tag combinations only work at specific scales:
- Personal Scale: Individual synergies ([Enhanced] + [Precise])
- Vehicle Scale: Team synergies ([Leadership] + [Tactical])
- Starship Scale: Organization synergies ([Elite] + [Network])
- Fleet Scale: Galactic synergies ([Legendary] + [Mythic])

## Assistance and Group Efforts

### Simple Assistance
One character helps another:
- Helper rolls their check
- Success grants +2 to primary actor
- Critical success grants +3
- Failure provides no benefit
- Critical failure imposes -1

### Skilled Assistance
When helper has relevant skill:
- Must have skill 3+ to provide skilled help
- Helper rolls vs TN 11
- Success grants +2 (or +3 on critical)
- Can explain approach for better bonus

### Group Efforts
Multiple characters working together:
- Designate primary actor
- Each helper who succeeds adds +1
- Maximum bonus: +5
- Critical failures create complications

## Doubles and Extreme Results

When both dice show the same number, results become more extreme:

**High Doubles** (6-6 through 10-10):
- Emphasize success dramatically
- Add narrative flourish
- Possible reputation gain
- May inspire allies

**Middle Doubles** (3-3 through 5-5):
- Solid, reliable results
- Things go exactly as planned
- No surprises either way

**Low Doubles** (1-1 through 2-2):
- Emphasize failure memorably
- Add complications
- Possible reputation loss
- May demoralize allies

## Saving Throws

When reacting to danger, make a saving throw:

**Save Formula**: 2d10 + Attribute vs TN

**Common Saves**:
- **Might**: Resist poison, disease, physical transformation
- **Coordination**: Dodge explosions, avoid traps, maintain balance
- **Awareness**: Detect ambush, avoid surprise, react quickly
- **Intellect**: Recognize illusions, solve puzzles under pressure
- **Resolve**: Resist fear, maintain sanity, concentrate through pain
- **Presence**: Avoid social manipulation, maintain composure

### Save Target Numbers
- **Easy Save**: TN 11
- **Moderate Save**: TN 14
- **Hard Save**: TN 17
- **Extreme Save**: TN 20

## Skill and Tag Synergies

### Traditional Skill Synergies
When multiple skills apply to a situation:

**Primary + Supporting**: Use the higher skill as primary, gain +1 if supporting skill is 3+

**Examples**:
- Tech + Medicine: Cybernetic surgery
- Pilot + Combat: Fighter dogfighting
- Social + Investigation: Interrogation
- Stealth + Tech: Security system bypass

### Tag-Based Synergies (Primary System)
Tags create more dynamic synergies than traditional skill combinations:

**Cross-Skill Tag Synergies**:
- Combat [Enhanced] + Tech [Digital] = "Cyber-Warrior" (+2 dice)
- Pilot [Intuitive] + Perception [Tactical] = "Spatial Awareness" (+2 dice)
- Social [Leadership] + Command [Natural] = "Born Leader" (+3 dice)

**Single-Character Multi-Tag Chains**:
- [Enhanced] + [Digital] + [Tactical] = "Perfect weapon platform" (+4 dice)
- [Subtle] + [Patient] + [Precise] = "Invisible perfection" (+4 dice)

**Team Tag Synergies**:
When multiple characters coordinate complementary tags:
- Marcus [Enhanced] + Sarah [Digital] + Chen [Tactical] = "Hive Mind Protocol" (+3 dice to coordinated actions)

### Synergy Discovery
Players discover new synergies through:
- **Creative Application**: Trying new tag combinations in play
- **Narrative Description**: Explaining how tags work together
- **GM Reward**: 1-3 Advancement Points for innovative discoveries

## Extended Tasks

Some tasks require multiple successes over time:

**Complexity Levels**:
- Simple: 3 successes needed
- Moderate: 5 successes needed
- Complex: 8 successes needed
- Extreme: 12 successes needed

**Time per Check**: Varies by task
- Research: Hours or days
- Repairs: Minutes or hours
- Construction: Days or weeks

**Complications**: Critical failures remove one success or add complications
