# Chapter 9: Starships and Space Travel

The stars await. This chapter covers everything needed for interstellar adventure: operating starships, navigating the cosmos, surviving the void, and engaging in dramatic space combat. From single-seat fighters to massive dreadnoughts, these rules scale to tell any spacefaring story.

## Starship Basics

### Ship Statistics

**Core Systems**:
- **Size**: Fighter, Corvette, Frigate, Cruiser, Battleship
- **Speed**: Meters per round (combat), AU/day (system)
- **Handling**: Modifier to Pilot checks (-2 to +2)
- **Armor**: Damage reduction (3-20)
- **Hull**: Ship hit points (100-5000)
- **Shields**: Energy protection (50-500)
- **Crew**: Minimum/maximum operators
- **Power**: Available energy per round
- **Heat**: Maximum heat before penalties

### Ship Scales

Ships operate at two scales above personal:

**Starship Scale** (×100 damage):
- Fighters, shuttles, corvettes
- Crew: 1-50
- Hull: 100-1000

**Capital Scale** (×1000 damage):
- Frigates, cruisers, battleships
- Crew: 50-5000
- Hull: 1000-5000

### Crew Roles

**Captain**: Commands and coordinates
- Inspire crew (+1 to all rolls)
- Focus efforts (extra action to one station)
- Tactical assessment (reveal enemy stats)

**Pilot**: Maneuvers the ship
- Movement and positioning
- Evasive maneuvers (+2 Defense)
- Attack runs (+1 to weapons)

**Gunner**: Operates weapons
- Fire ship weapons
- Target specific systems
- Coordinate fire (+2 damage)

**Engineer**: Manages systems
- Damage control (repair Hull)
- Power management (boost systems)
- Emergency repairs (restore systems)

**Science Officer**: Sensors and analysis
- Scan targets (reveal information)
- Electronic warfare
- Navigate jump calculations

## Space Travel

### Sublight Movement

**System Travel**: Between planets
- Speed in AU (Astronomical Units) per day
- Fuel/reaction mass considerations
- Time dilation at high fractions of c

**Combat Movement**: Tactical positioning
- Speed in meters per round
- 3D positioning important
- Momentum carries between rounds

### FTL Travel - The Drift

The primary FTL method involves "drifting" through dimensional space:

**Drift Zones**:
- **Shallow Drift**: ×10 speed, TN 11 navigation, minor hazards
- **Mid Drift**: ×100 speed, TN 14 navigation, moderate hazards  
- **Deep Drift**: ×1000 speed, TN 17 navigation, severe hazards

**Entering Drift**:
1. Calculate route (Science + Pilot, TN varies)
2. Charge drift drive (10 minutes)
3. Transition (Pilot check)
4. Navigate to destination
5. Exit drift space

**Drift Hazards**:
- Dimensional storms (damage shields/hull)
- Drift entities (alien encounters)
- Time distortions (arrive late/early)
- Navigation errors (emerge off-course)
- Drive failures (stranded in drift)

### Alternative FTL - Nexus Gates

Ancient gate networks provide instant travel:

**Gate Travel**:
- Fixed point-to-point
- No skill checks required
- Limited to gate locations
- May require access codes
- Subject to blockades

**Gate Types**:
- System gates: Within star system
- Sector gates: Between nearby stars
- Nexus gates: Cross-galaxy links
- Rogue gates: Unknown destinations

## Starship Combat

### Combat Sequence

1. **Detection**: Determine awareness and range
2. **Initiative**: 1d10 + Pilot's Awareness + Ship Handling
3. **Movement**: In initiative order, considering momentum
4. **Actions**: Crew members act on ship's turn
5. **Damage**: Apply results

### Movement and Positioning

**3D Space**: Track relative positions
- Use zones or grid
- Facing matters for shields
- Momentum continues

**Movement Options**:
- **Maintain Course**: Continue current vector
- **Accelerate**: Increase speed
- **Decelerate**: Reduce speed  
- **Turn**: Change facing (limited by speed)
- **Evasive**: +2 Defense, -2 to attacks

### Weapons and Attacks

**Attack Roll**: 2d10 + Coordination + (Pilot ÷ 2) + Weapon + Targeting

**Weapon Types**:
- **Kinetic**: Projectiles, ignores shields, -2 vs fast targets
- **Energy**: Lasers/plasma, reduced by shields, accurate
- **Missiles**: Guided, can be intercepted, high damage

**Targeting Options**:
- **Hull**: Standard attack
- **Systems**: -2 to hit, disables specific system
- **Precision**: -4 to hit, bypasses armor

### Defense and Shields

**Defense**: 10 + Pilot's Coordination + (Pilot ÷ 2) + Handling + Size

**Shield Management**:
- Shields have four facings (Fore, Aft, Port, Starboard)
- Distribute shield points between facings
- Engineer can reinforce specific facing
- Regenerate slowly (10% per round)

**Armor**: Reduces damage after shields
- Does not degrade
- Ineffective against some weapons
- Can be bypassed by critical hits

### Damage and Systems

**Damage Application**:
1. Target shield facing absorbs damage
2. Excess reduced by armor
3. Remaining damages hull
4. Check for system damage

**Hull Thresholds**:
- **Undamaged** (90-100%): Full capability
- **Light Damage** (70-89%): -1 to all rolls
- **Moderate Damage** (50-69%): -2 rolls, one system damaged
- **Heavy Damage** (30-49%): -3 rolls, half speed, two systems damaged
- **Critical Damage** (10-29%): -4 rolls, minimal power, three systems damaged
- **Destroyed** (0-9%): Drifting hulk, abandon ship
- **Vaporized** (-10% or less): Completely destroyed

**System Damage** (Roll d10):
1. Engines (half speed)
2. Weapons (one offline)
3. Shields (no regeneration)
4. Sensors (-4 to detection)
5. Life Support (crew at risk)
6. Communications (no coordination)
