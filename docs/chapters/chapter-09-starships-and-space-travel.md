# Chapter 9: Starships and Space Travel

In the vast cosmos, starships are more than metal and circuits—they're living legends with souls forged in the crucible of space. The Universal Tag System transforms every vessel from a mere vehicle into a character with personality, history, and deep bonds with its crew. From scrappy freighters that always escape by luck to legendary warships that inspire through mere presence, tags make every ship unique.
