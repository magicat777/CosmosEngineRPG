# Sector Generation System

## Overview

The Sector Generation System provides Game Masters with tools for creating consistent, interesting campaign areas at the galactic scale. It integrates with the Cosmos Engine setting framework to produce sectors that support long-term campaigns with exploration, politics, and adventure opportunities.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Generate sectors that tell stories through their structure
- Balance exploration opportunity with political complexity
- Scale appropriately for campaign length and scope
- Integrate with faction and organizational systems
- Support multiple campaign themes within single sector
