### Summary of Changes
- Established baseline documentation for Cosmos Engine RPG v3.0
- Consolidated multiple combat system iterations
- Defined core resolution mechanics (2d10 + modifiers)
- Implemented four-scale system (Personal, Vehicle, Starship, Capital)
- Created EVE-inspired character advancement system
- Established Technology Era framework
- Set complexity budget targets for all systems

### Known Issues
- Attribute system definitions pending (see section 375-384 in system_summary.md)

## Version 3.1.0 - Drift Analysis Framework
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Type**: Minor Release  
**Author**: System Architecture Team

### Files Added
- `core-rules/core-mechanics-reference.md` - Quick reference for core mechanics validation
- `design-notes/drift-decisions.md` - Log of intentional mechanical variations
- `development/mechanics-workshop/drift-analysis-framework.md` - Framework for detecting drift
- `development/mechanics-workshop/mechanics-tracker.md` - Active tracking of all mechanics
- `development/mechanics-workshop/drift-analysis-report.md` - Initial system analysis
- `resources/templates/rule-validation-checklist.md` - Checklist for new rule validation

### Summary of Changes
- Established drift detection and management system
- Created validation tools for mechanical consistency
- Documented existing intentional variances
- Identified attribute system as critical gap
- Set up ongoing monitoring framework

### Key Findings
- Core mechanics consistency: 92/100
- Intentional drifts: Initiative simplification, damage dice variety
- Critical gap: Attribute system undefined
- Overall system health: Good

### Review Requirements
- Check all new mechanics against core reference
- Use validation checklist for new rules
- Update tracker monthly
- Document all drift decisions

## Version 3.2.0 - Attribute System Definition
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Type**: Minor Release  
**Author**: System Design Team

### Files Added
- `core-rules/attribute-system.md` - Complete attribute system definition
- `development/mechanics-workshop/attribute-system-analysis.md` - Analysis of proposed system

### Files Modified
- `development/mechanics-workshop/mechanics-tracker.md` - Updated attribute system status
- `docs/design-notes/drift-decisions.md` - Added scale-based modifier cap decision

### Summary of Changes
- Defined six core attributes: Might, Coordination, Intellect, Awareness, Presence, Resolve
- Established cross-scale applications for all attributes
- Set attribute ranges (0-5, max 6 at level 20)
- Created derived statistics (HP, Initiative, Defenses, Strain)
- Implemented scale-based modifier caps (Personal +8, Starship +10, Capital +12)

### Design Decisions
- Maintained 2d10 for initiative (not 1d10)
- Capped HP at reasonable range (10-30)
- Technology enhances but doesn't replace attributes
- Every attribute has vital applications (no dump stats)

### Integration Notes
- All attributes work identically across scales
- Modifier caps adjust by scale to represent assistance
- Technology Era provides temporary enhancements only

## Version 3.2.1 - Phase 1 Attribute Integration
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Type**: Patch Release  
**Author**: System Integration Team

### Files Modified
- `core-rules/system_summary.md` - Updated initiative formula, added attribute definitions, completed character creation
- `core-rules/core-mechanics-reference.md` - Added attribute definitions and derived statistics
- `character-system/cosmos_character_system.md` - Integrated attributes into character creation
- `combat-system/cosmos_combat_streamlined.md` - Changed "Will check" to "Resolve check"
- `design-notes/drift-decisions.md` - Updated initiative drift documentation

### Summary of Changes
- Updated all initiative references from "Reaction + Agility" to "Coordination + Awareness"
- Added complete attribute definitions to core references
- Integrated attribute generation into character creation process
- Added derived statistics formulas (HP, Defenses, Strain)
- Fixed terminology (Will â†’ Resolve)

### Integration Progress
- Phase 1 Complete: Core attribute references updated
- Ready for Phase 2: Skill-attribute pairings and combat examples
- Attribute system now fully referenced in core documentation
