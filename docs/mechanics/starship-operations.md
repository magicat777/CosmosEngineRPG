## Advanced Combat Mechanics

### Range Bands

Space combat uses abstract ranges:

| Range | Description | Weapon Modifiers |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Point Blank | Same hex/ramming | +2 to hit, +2 damage |
| Close | 1-2 hexes | Normal |
| Medium | 3-5 hexes | Normal |
| Long | 6-10 hexes | -2 to hit |
| Extreme | 11+ hexes | -4 to hit, some weapons can't reach |

### Maneuvering

Ships have Maneuver Ratings:
- **Clumsy (-2)**: Bulk freighters, damaged ships
- **Poor (-1)**: Heavy warships, cargo haulers  
- **Average (0)**: Most ships
- **Agile (+1)**: Fighters, corvettes
- **Nimble (+2)**: Interceptors, racing craft

Maneuver affects:
- Defense value
- Initiative
- Pursuit/escape rolls
- Ramming attacks

### Heat Management

Energy weapons generate heat:
- Level 0: Normal operation
- Level 1: -1 to attacks
- Level 2: -2 to attacks, -1 defense
- Level 3: -4 to attacks, random shutdowns
- Level 4: Systems offline

Heat dissipation:
- 1 level/round normal
- 2 levels/round if not firing
- Engineer can vent 1 extra level

### Shield Operations

Shields have facing and can be reinforced:

**Shield Arcs:**
- Forward
- Port/Starboard
- Aft

**Shield Management:**
- Standard: Equal distribution
- Focused: Double one arc, others half
- Rotating: Shift strength between arcs

**Shield Special Rules:**
- Regenerate 10% per round if not hit
- Can overcharge for +50% strength (burns out after)
- Can extend to protect allied ship (half strength)

### Critical Hits

On natural 20 or margin of 10+:

**Location Roll (2d10):**
- 2-4: Hull Breach (atmosphere venting)
- 5-7: Weapon Destroyed
- 8-10: Engine Damage (half speed)
- 11-13: Shield Generator Hit
- 14-16: Sensor Array Destroyed
- 17-18: Bridge Hit (crew casualties)
- 19: Power Core Leak (radiation)
- 20: Catastrophic Damage (roll twice)

### Environmental Hazards

Space is dangerous:

#### Asteroid Fields
- Pilot rolls to navigate
- Failure: 2d10 damage
- Can hide: +4 to stealth

## Quick Reference

### Combat Sequence
1. Detect enemies (sensors)
2. Determine range
3. Roll initiative
4. Declare actions by position
5. Resolve in initiative order
6. Apply damage/effects
7. Check morale/systems

### Common Modifiers
- **To Hit**: Range, ECM, damage
- **Damage**: Weapons, range, criticals

### Quick Rulings
When in doubt:
- Difficulty 11 for standard tasks
- +2/-2 for major advantages/disadvantages
