# Cross-Tag Compatibility System

## Core Mechanics

### **Synergy Levels**
When tags from different skills combine, they create synergies:

**Perfect Synergy (+3 dice)**
- Tags that naturally amplify each other
- Creates new emergent abilities
- Once per scene without cost

**Strong Synergy (+2 dice)**
- Tags that work well together
- Standard compatibility bonus
- Usable whenever both apply

**Basic Synergy (+1 die)**
- Tags that complement without conflict
- Minor benefit for coordination
- Always available

**Conflict (-1 to -2 dice)**
- Tags that oppose each other
- Creates internal tension
- Player must choose which dominates

## **Multi-Tag Synergy Chains**

### **Three-Tag Combinations**
When three or more compatible tags combine:

**Triple Synergy Examples:**
- [Precise] + [Patient] + [Digital] = "Quantum Targeting" (+4 dice, reality-bending accuracy)
- [Brutal] + [Enhanced] + [Aggressive] = "Cybernetic Rampage" (+4 dice, unstoppable force)
- [Subtle] + [Social] + [Creative] = "Master Manipulator" (+4 dice, invisible influence)
- [Tactical] + [Leadership] + [Veteran] = "Supreme Commander" (+4 dice, perfect coordination)

### **Cross-Skill Tag Webs**
When tags from multiple skills interconnect:

**Example: The Digital Warrior**
- Combat: [Enhanced] - Neural combat implants
- Tech: [Digital] - Consciousness in the network
- Pilot: [Technical] - Ships as extended body
- **Web Effect**: All three create "Omnipresent Warrior" - Fight through any connected system

**Example: The Natural Leader**
- Command: [Leadership] - Born to lead
- Persuasion: [Social] - Understands people
- Knowledge: [Tactical] - Sees the big picture
- **Web Effect**: Creates "Legendary Commander" - Armies follow without question

## **Tag Evolution Synergies**

### **Rank-Based Compatibility**
As skills advance, tag synergies evolve:

**Ranks 1-3 (Basic Synergy)**
- Simple combinations
- +1 to +2 dice maximum
- Discovering connections

**Ranks 4-6 (Advanced Synergy)**
- Complex interactions
- +2 to +3 dice common
- Creating new techniques

**Ranks 7-9 (Master Synergy)**
- Transcendent combinations
- +3 to +4 dice possible
- Redefining possibilities

**Rank 10 (Legendary Synergy)**
- Reality-altering fusions
- +4 to +5 dice maximum
- Becoming the synergy

## **Conflict Resolution**

### **When Tags Oppose**
Some tag combinations create internal conflict:

**Opposed Pairs:**
- [Brutal] vs [Subtle]: Force vs finesse
- [Reckless] vs [Patient]: Speed vs caution
- [Digital] vs [Natural]: Tech vs organic
- [Aggressive] vs [Defensive]: Attack vs protect

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Choose Dominant**: Pick which tag leads (-1 die)
2. **Find Balance**: Describe creative fusion (0 dice, narrative benefit)
3. **Accept Conflict**: Take -2 dice but gain 1 AP for complication
4. **Transcend Opposition**: At Rank 10, merge opposites (+1 die)

## **Synergy Discovery**

### **Finding New Combinations**
Players discover synergies through:

**Experimentation**
- Try combining tags in new situations
- GM awards bonus dice for creative combos
- Document successful synergies

**Training Together**
- Characters with compatible tags train
- Develop team techniques
- Share tag benefits temporarily

**Story Evolution**
- Major story events create new synergies
- Overcoming challenges together
- Tags evolve based on experiences

### **Custom Synergies**
Tables can create unique combinations:

**Session Zero Activity:**
1. List all party tags
2. Players propose synergies
3. GM sets bonus levels
4. Document for campaign

**Example Custom Synergy:**
"[Marcus's Enhanced] + [Sarah's Digital] + [Chen's Tactical] = 'Hive Mind Protocol'"
- Effect: Share sensory data and tactical analysis in real-time
- Bonus: +3 dice when all three coordinate
- Limitation: Requires network connection
- Discovery: Created during desperate fleet battle

## **GM Guidelines**

### **Encouraging Synergy Discovery**
- **Spotlight Moments**: Create scenes requiring specific synergies
- **NPC Examples**: Show enemies using tag combinations
- **Environmental Rewards**: Areas that enhance certain synergies
- **Story Integration**: Major plot points around tag compatibility

### **Balancing Synergies**
- **Power Scaling**: Higher ranks unlock stronger synergies
- **Resource Cost**: Powerful combos require AP investment
- **Situational Limits**: Not all synergies work everywhere
- **Narrative Requirements**: Must describe how tags combine

### **Campaign Integration**
- **Synergy Journal**: Party tracks discovered combinations
- **Evolution Milestones**: Major synergies at levels 5, 10, 15, 20
- **Legendary Techniques**: Rank 10 creates setting-changing synergies
- **Legacy Effects**: Famous synergies become part of world lore
