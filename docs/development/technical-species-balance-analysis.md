# Technical Species Balance Analysis

## Space Survival Advantages

### Synthetics in Space
**Major Advantages:**
- No oxygen needed (infinite EVA time)
- No food/water requirements (no supply logistics)
- Immune to radiation (no shielding needed)
- No gravity sickness or bone loss
- Can survive hull breaches indefinitely
- Can operate in extreme temperatures
- No sleep requirements (24/7 operations)

**Cost Comparison:**
- Biological species EVA suit: 5,000-15,000 credits
- Life support supplies per month: 500-1,000 credits
- Radiation medicine: 200 credits/dose
- Synthetic maintenance: 500 credits/month

### Augments in Space
**Moderate Advantages:**
- Enhanced radiation resistance (cybernetic shielding)
- Reduced oxygen needs (artificial lungs)
- Better zero-g adaptation (enhanced inner ear)
- Can survive brief vacuum exposure
- Less food/water needed

**Still Requires:**
- Some oxygen (emergency reserves last longer)
- Minimal food/water
- Temperature regulation
- Pressure suits for extended EVA

## Balancing Mechanisms

### 1. Environmental Hazards

**EMP/Electrical Attacks**
- **Synthetics**: Stunned for 1-3 rounds, systems reboot needed
- **Augments**: -2 to all rolls, cybernetics offline
- **Frequency**: Should appear in ~25% of combat encounters

**Ion Storms/Solar Flares**
- **Synthetics**: Must shelter or take 1d6 damage/hour
- **Augments**: Cybernetics glitch (-1 to rolls)
- **Biological**: Unaffected with basic shielding

**Magnetic Fields**
- **Synthetics**: Movement halved, -2 to physical actions
- **Augments**: Disorientation, -1 to actions
- **Biological**: No effect

### 2. Hacking Vulnerabilities

**Direct Neural Hacking**
- **Synthetics**: Can be targeted by Tech attacks like physical combat
- **Augments**: Mental defense replaced by Tech defense vs hackers
- **Biological**: Immune to digital attacks

**Virus/Malware**
- **Synthetics**: Save or be "poisoned" (system corruption)
- **Augments**: Save or lose cybernetic functions
- **Biological**: Completely immune

**Control Override**
- **Synthetics**: Critical failure on mental saves = brief puppet mode
- **Augments**: Cyberlimbs can be hijacked temporarily
- **Biological**: Cannot be digitally controlled

### 3. Maintenance Requirements

**Synthetics**
- Weekly maintenance or cumulative -1 penalty
- Specialized parts needed (not available everywhere)
- Tech skill required (can't self-repair easily)
- No natural healing (all damage requires repairs)

**Augments**  
- Monthly maintenance (500 credits)
- Rejection drugs needed in some systems
- Partial healing only (50% from medicine)
- Cybernetics can break separately from health

### 4. Social Disadvantages

**Synthetics**
- Many stations have "No AI" policies
- Viewed as property in some systems
- Cannot feel emotions the same way
- Uncanny valley effects (-2 Presence base)

**Augments**
- "Cyber-psycho" stereotypes
- Religious objections in some cultures  
- Corporate ownership of some augmentations
- Visible modifications cause fear

## Specific Counter-Scenarios

### Electrical Dampening Fields

**Effect Levels:**

**Light Dampening** (emergency ship systems)
- Synthetics: -1 to all actions
- Augments: Choose 1 cybernetic system offline
- Duration: While in field

**Moderate Dampening** (security zones)
- Synthetics: -2 to all actions, speed halved
- Augments: Half cybernetics offline
- Duration: While in field + 1d6 rounds

**Heavy Dampening** (military grade)
- Synthetics: Paralyzed, emergency power only
- Augments: All cybernetics offline, -3 to actions
- Duration: While in field + 1 minute

**Total Blackout** (rare, plot device)
- Synthetics: Complete shutdown, require external restart
- Augments: Biological functions only
- Duration: Until manually reactivated

### EMP Effects Table

| Severity | Synthetics | Augments | Recovery |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Glancing | Stunned 1 round | -1 for scene | Automatic |
| Direct | Stunned 1d6 rounds | -2 for scene | Tech DC 14 |
| Critical | Shutdown, reboot needed | Cybernetics fried | Tech DC 17 + repairs |

## GM Balancing Tools

### 1. **Encounter Design**
- Include 1 EMP/hacking threat per session
- Mix physical and digital challenges
- Use environments that favor biologicals sometimes

### 2. **Resource Management**
- Technical species need specialized facilities
- Repairs cost more than medical treatment
- Parts availability varies by location

### 3. **Story Integration**
- Anti-AI prejudice creates roleplay challenges
- Maintenance downtime prevents constant activity
- Digital consciousness has unique problems

### 4. **Tactical Considerations**

**Anti-Technical Weapons** (available to NPCs)
- EMP grenades (common security tool)
- Disruptor rifles (shut down cybernetics)
- Scramblers (cause glitches and reboots)
- Virus bombs (area denial vs. technical)

**Environmental Challenges**
- Ancient ruins with no power sources
- Planets with electromagnetic storms  
- Faraday cage prisons
- Organic-only sacred spaces

## Recommended Implementation

### Core Rule
"Technical species gain significant advantages in space but face unique vulnerabilities. GMs should include anti-technical challenges in approximately 1/3 of encounters to maintain balance."

### Quick Balance Check
If technical species are dominating:
1. Increase EMP weapon frequency
2. Add more hacking attempts
3. Enforce maintenance strictly
4. Use social prejudice more

If technical species are struggling:
1. Reduce EMP duration
2. Allow Tech defense vs. hacking
3. Make parts more available
4. Ease social restrictions

### Design Philosophy
Technical species should feel different, not superior. Their advantages in space are balanced by vulnerabilities to common security measures and social challenges. The goal is asymmetric balance - they excel in some situations and struggle in others.

## Player Experience During Disruption

### Synthetics in EMP/Dampening
**Light**: "Your processes slow, like thinking through syrup."
**Moderate**: "Warning messages flood your consciousness. Motor control stutters."
**Heavy**: "Systems failing. You're trapped in your own body, watching helplessly."
**Total**: "Darkness. Then nothing. Time passes without meaning..."

### Augments in EMP/Dampening  
**Light**: "Your chrome aches. The seamless integration feels... wrong."
**Moderate**: "Your cyber-arm hangs dead. Your enhanced vision fills with static."
**Heavy**: "You're more meat than machine now, and the meat remembers its weakness."
**Total**: "Every augmentation screams in protest before going silent. You're merely human again."

## Conclusion

Technical species are powerful in space but not game-breaking if properly balanced. Their advantages create interesting crew dynamics (send the Synthetic on the dangerous EVA) while their vulnerabilities ensure biological species remain relevant. The key is making their weaknesses as interesting as their strengths.
