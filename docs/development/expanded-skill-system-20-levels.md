## Balancing the Expanded Scale

Easy:       TN 11 (Level 3-4 appropriate)
Moderate:   TN 14 (Level 5-6 appropriate)
Hard:       TN 17 (Level 7-8 appropriate)
Extreme:    TN 20 (Level 9-10 appropriate)
Legendary:  TN 23 (Level 11-14 appropriate)
Impossible: TN 26 (Level 15-17 appropriate)
Mythic:     TN 29 (Level 18-19 appropriate)
Divine:     TN 32 (Level 20 appropriate)
```

### Maximum Bonuses by Tier
