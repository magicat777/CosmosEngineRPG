## Next Steps (Week 2)

### Immediate Priority:
1. Create Chapter 11: Running Cosmos Engine (GM guide)
2. Begin Phase 2 preparation

### Phase 1 Remaining:
- All Phase 1 objectives completed ahead of schedule
- Can begin Phase 2 (Chapters 11-13) immediately

### Documentation Needs:
- Update chapter index
- Verify all cross-references
- Create transition guide for Phase 2

## Recommendations

1. **Early Phase 2 Start**: With Phase 1 complete in Week 1, recommend beginning Phase 2 immediately
2. **Playtest Package**: Chapters 1-7 now form complete player-facing rules for playtesting
3. **GM Priority**: Chapter 11 is critical for running games with current content

## Summary

Phase 1 completed successfully with all objectives met. The core personal scale rules are now properly organized into three focused chapters that provide:
- Complete skill system with specializations
- Balanced combat mechanics with tactical depth
- Comprehensive equipment across all technology levels

The foundation is solid for building the remaining chapters. The balanced combat system is fully integrated throughout, ensuring consistent gameplay from levels 1-20.
