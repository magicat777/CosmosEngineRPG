# Mass Combat System - Product Review Submission

## Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the Mass Combat system for Cosmos Engine RPG, creating a unified four-scale combat framework that seamlessly integrates Personal → Vehicle → Starship → Mass Combat operations. This system enables campaigns ranging from intimate crew adventures (Firefly) to galaxy-spanning warfare (StarCraft/Foundation) while maintaining consistent core mechanics.

**Key Achievement**: Complete scale integration using unified 2d10 resolution across all combat types, with optional complexity allowing groups to choose their preferred narrative scope.
