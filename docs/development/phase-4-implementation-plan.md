## System Integration Requirements

### Mathematical Consistency
All Phase 4 systems must maintain:
- **2d10 core resolution**: All new mechanics use established dice system
- **85% hit rate target**: Combat-adjacent systems maintain tactical balance
- **Skill scaling**: (Skill Ã· 2) formula applies to all relevant mechanics
- **Level gap rules**: Minion/mook mechanics extend to new systems

### Equipment Integration
New systems must work with:
- **+0 to +3 equipment scaling**: No inflation beyond established limits
- **Technology era progression**: All systems scale across 4 eras
- **Balanced equipment guide**: New items follow established design principles

### Character Compatibility
All systems must support:
- **Existing character builds**: 6 example characters work with new mechanics
- **Archetype balance**: No system favors one character type exclusively
- **Level 1-20 progression**: All mechanics scale appropriately across levels
