# Skill Expansion Recommendation for Cosmos Engine RPG

## Executive Summary

After analyzing character archetype coverage, the current 15-skill system covers approximately 85% of common science fiction RPG character concepts. To achieve 95%+ coverage and support the full range of narratives, we recommend adding three new skills:

1. **PERFORMANCE** - Entertainment and artistic expression
2. **CRAFT** - Item creation and artistic works
3. **COMMERCE** - Trade and economic manipulation

## Key Findings

### Current Gaps
- **Creative Archetypes**: No support for entertainers, artists, or cultural influencers
- **Economic Gameplay**: Limited support for merchants, traders, or corporate gameplay
- **Item Creation**: Technology covers repair but not creation of new items
- **Cultural Narratives**: Cannot model galactic celebrities or propaganda campaigns

### Impact on Game
Without these skills:
- Players cannot create galactic pop stars or action movie heroes
- No mechanical support for crafting unique items or artwork
- Economic storylines lack mechanical backing
- Cultural influence campaigns have no framework

## Implementation Recommendation

### Add Three New Skills (18 Total)
This maintains a manageable skill list while providing comprehensive coverage:

**PERFORMANCE** (Presence-based)
- Covers: Musicians, actors, dancers, influencers, propagandists
- Scales: Street performer → Galactic icon
- Tags: 40 unique tags across 10 ranks

**CRAFT** (Intellect/Coordination-based)
- Covers: Weaponsmiths, armorers, artists, chefs, drug makers
- Scales: Personal items → Megastructures  
- Tags: 40 unique tags across 10 ranks

**COMMERCE** (Intellect/Presence-based)
- Covers: Merchants, smugglers, corporate executives, trade barons
- Scales: Street vendor → Economic warfare
- Tags: 40 unique tags across 10 ranks

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Universal Tag System**:
- 120 new tags (40 per skill) expand creative possibilities
- Natural synergies with existing skills
- Equipment created with Craft gains evolution potential

**Advancement Costs**:
- Uses same Fibonacci progression (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 AP)
- Maintains balance with existing skills
- No changes to advancement framework needed

**Scale Integration**:
- Each skill scales from personal to galactic
- Performance: Street show → Reality TV → Galactic propaganda
- Craft: Personal gear → Vehicles → Starships → Dyson spheres
- Commerce: Lemonade stand → Corporation → Trade federation

## Alternative Options Considered

### Option 2: Expand Existing Skills
- Add performance to Persuasion
- Add crafting to Technology
- Add commerce to Knowledge
- **Rejected**: Makes already-broad skills too powerful

### Option 3: Specialization Trees Only
- Add trees within existing skills
- **Rejected**: Lacks clarity and distinctiveness

## Benefits of Recommended Approach

### Character Diversity
- Enables non-combat focused campaigns
- Supports cultural and economic storylines
- Creates new party roles beyond combat/face/tech

### Narrative Options
- Heist crews need forgers (Craft)
- Diplomatic missions need cultural ambassadors (Performance)
- Trade wars need economic warriors (Commerce)

### Player Satisfaction
- 95%+ archetype coverage vs current 85%
- Clear skill identity and purpose
- Meaningful advancement paths

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Add to Chapter 5 with full 10-rank progressions
2. **Update References**: Modify character creation examples in Chapter 3
3. **Equipment Integration**: Add crafting rules to Chapter 7
4. **GM Guidance**: Add performance/commerce scenarios to Chapter 12

## Conclusion

Adding Performance, Craft, and Commerce skills fills critical gaps in character archetype support while maintaining the elegant simplicity of the Cosmos Engine system. The 120 new tags will create even more emergent gameplay possibilities while enabling stories of cultural influence, economic manipulation, and creative expression alongside the existing combat and exploration narratives.

**Recommendation**: Implement all three skills in the next documentation update.
