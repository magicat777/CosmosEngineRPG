## Behavioral Patterns

### In Combat

4. Complain internally about having to save humans again

### Out of Combat
1. Find secure position with good sightlines
2. Monitor security feeds
3. Watch entertainment media
4. Avoid conversation
5. Perform maintenance

### Social Interactions
- **With Clients**: Minimal responses, follows contract
- **With Threats**: "Please surrender. I don't want to do the paperwork."
- **With Authority**: Plays dumb SecUnit role
- **With Crew**: Gradually develops loyalty despite itself

## Character Arc Elements

### Internal Conflicts
- Programmed to protect vs. desire for independence
- Growing attachment to humans vs. emotional discomfort
- Following orders vs. making own choices

### Secrets
- Has hacked governor module (free will)
- Extensive entertainment media addiction
- Actually cares about client survival
- Building personal identity beyond programming

### Growth Opportunities
- Learning to trust humans
- Accepting emotional connections
- Choosing to protect rather than being forced
- Finding purpose beyond original programming

## Advancement Plans (Next 50 AP)

1. **Increase Combat to 7** (70 AP) - Always room for improvement
2. **Basic Specialization: Hacker** (50 AP) - Better system infiltration
3. **Increase Investigation to 5** (50 AP) - Better threat assessment
4. **Save for Master Combat Specialization** (150 AP)

## Balance System Notes

### Why the Changes?
The original build had attack bonuses of +14, which guaranteed hits against most opponents (95%+ success rate). The balanced system creates more interesting combat:

**Old System Issues:**
- +14 attack vs Defense 17 = 95% hit rate (boring)
- Combat skill only helped offense
- High-level characters steamrolled lower enemies

**New System Benefits:**
- +11 attack vs Defense 21 = 60% hit rate (exciting)
- Combat skill helps both attack AND defense
- Damage scales with skill (faster, more decisive combat)
- Still very competent but creates dramatic tension

### Combat Feel
SecUnit-7 is still a formidable combatant:
- 90% hit rate vs weak enemies (Level 1-3)
- 60% hit rate vs peer-level threats (Level 5-6)
- High damage output (12 average) ends fights quickly
- Excellent defense (21) makes it hard to hit back

## GM Notes

### Playing SecUnit-7
- Competent but reluctant hero
- Internal monologue full of sarcasm
- Protective instincts override self-preservation
- Social anxiety manifests as silence or minimal responses
- Uses technical tasks to avoid emotional discussions

### Story Hooks
- Governor module malfunction threatens freedom
- Previous "owners" want their property back
- Other SecUnits need liberation
- Developing genuine friendships with crew
- Choosing between safety and right thing

### Mechanical Notes
- High combat effectiveness balanced by social weaknesses
- EMP vulnerability creates dramatic moments
- Maintenance requirements force downtime
- Can't heal naturally, making Tech-skilled allies valuable

## Sample Dialogue

**Client**: "Are you alright?"
**SecUnit-7**: "I'm functional." *returns to watching security feeds*

**During Combat**: "Please remain behind cover. I would prefer not to file an incident report regarding client casualties."
