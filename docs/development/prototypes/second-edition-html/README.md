3. **Study Tag Synergies** - Examples show how tags combine for different character builds

## System Corrections Made

### Before (Inconsistent)
- ❌ Some skills had 10 ranks, others had 7
- ❌ Five mastery tiers created confusion
- ❌ Missing archetypes (performers, crafters, traders)
- ❌ Inconsistent tag progression

### After (Standardized)
- ✅ All skills have exactly 7 ranks at standardized levels
- ✅ Four clear mastery tiers with logical progression
- ✅ Complete archetype coverage with 18 skills
- ✅ Unified tag system with synergy mechanics

## Technical Implementation

### Visual Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth animations
- **Tier Color Coding**: Visual distinction between mastery levels
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design language across all trees

### Tag System Features
