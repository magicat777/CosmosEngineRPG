## Core Combat Foundation

### Universal Resolution Mechanic
**2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Equipment vs Target Number**

All combat actions use this core resolution across four operational scales with unified mechanics but different damage representation.

### Operational Scales
- **Personal Scale**: Individual characters, Hit Points for damage
- **Vehicle Scale**: Small craft, tanks, Condition Tracks for damage  
- **Starship Scale**: Large vessels, Condition Tracks for damage
- **Capital Scale**: Massive ships/installations, Condition Tracks for damage

### Combat Foundation Elements
- **Initiative**: 2d10 + Reaction + Agility Rating
- **Action Economy**: Move + Standard + Free actions per turn
- **Power Management**: Offense/Defense allocation with different timing by scale
- **Cross-Scale Combat**: Â±2 hit modifier per scale difference
- **Technology Era Equipment**: Caps from +1 (Primitive) to +5 (Cosmic)
- **Defense Categories**: Passive/Active/Electronic with +6 maximum total

## Movement & Positioning Framework

### Universal Range Band System

Range bands scale by operational level, maintaining tactical relationships across all scales:

| Scale | Close | Short | Medium | Long | Extreme |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| **Personal** | 0-2m | 3-10m | 11-50m | 51-250m | 251m+ |
| **Vehicle** | 0-50m | 51-500m | 0.5-5km | 5-25km | 25km+ |
| **Starship** | 0-1km | 1-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000km+ |
| **Capital** | 0-10km | 10-100km | 100-1000km | 1000-10000km | 10000km+ |

### Movement Actions & Mechanics

**Movement Allowance**: Base Move + Agility Rating in range bands per Move Action
- **Personal Scale**: 1 + Agility (typically 2-4 bands)
- **Vehicle+ Scales**: Depends on propulsion system, modified by pilot skill

**Movement Types**:
- **Tactical Move** (Free Action): 1 range band, no penalties
- **Combat Move** (Move Action): Full movement allowance
- **Sprint/Burn** (Standard Action): Double movement, -2 to all other actions this turn
- **Evasive Movement** (Move Action): Half movement, +2 Defense this turn

### Range Modifiers
Applied to attack rolls based on engagement distance:

- **Close**: +2 attack (enables melee/close-quarters weapons)
- **Short**: +1 attack (optimal for most personal weapons)
- **Medium**: No modifier (standard engagement range)
- **Long**: -1 attack (favors long-range weapons)
- **Extreme**: -2 attack (requires specialized equipment)

### Cover & Concealment System
- **Light Cover**: +1 Defense (corner of wall, debris)
- **Heavy Cover**: +2 Defense (behind solid wall, vehicle hull)
- **Total Cover**: Cannot be targeted directly
- **Concealment**: -1 to enemy attack rolls (smoke, darkness, sensor jamming)
- **Elevation Advantage**: +1 attack when firing from higher position

---

## Perception & Line-of-Sight System

### Universal Targeting Process

Every attack requires establishing **Line-of-Sight (LOS)** through this sequence:

1. **Range Check**: Is target within weapon range?
2. **LOS Check**: Can you draw an unobstructed line to target?
3. **Perception Check**: Can you detect/identify the target?
4. **Cover Assessment**: What protection does the target have?
5. **Final Attack**: Apply all modifiers and resolve

### Core Mechanic Integration

**Perception Check**: 2d10 + Perception Attribute + Awareness Skill + Equipment vs Detection Difficulty

**Base Detection Difficulties**:
- **Obvious Target**: 10 (standing in the open)
- **Partially Hidden**: 12 (using cover/concealment)
- **Well Hidden**: 15 (multiple concealment layers)
- **Nearly Invisible**: 18 (active camouflage/cloaking)
- **Impossible**: 21+ (perfect invisibility/phase shifted)

### Physical Cover Categories

**LIGHT COVER** (+1 Defense, blocks 25% of target)
- *Personal*: Corner of building, vehicle door, tree trunk
- *Vehicle+*: Asteroid fragment, debris field, structural element
- **LOS Effect**: Can target normally, +1 Defense to target

**HEAVY COVER** (+2 Defense, blocks 50% of target)
- *Personal*: Behind wall with window, vehicle hull, large boulder
- *Vehicle+*: Large asteroid, space station module, planet limb
- **LOS Effect**: Can target normally, +2 Defense to target

**SUPERIOR COVER** (+3 Defense, blocks 75% of target)
- *Personal*: Firing port, murder hole, narrow gap
- *Vehicle+*: Dense asteroid cluster, city ruins, orbital debris
- **LOS Effect**: Requires Perception Check (Difficulty 12) to target, +3 Defense

**TOTAL COVER** (Cannot target, blocks 100% of target)
- *Personal*: Behind solid wall, inside building, underground
- *Vehicle+*: Behind planet, inside space station, dense nebula core
- **LOS Effect**: No LOS possible, cannot target

### Partial Cover Situations

**EXPOSED POSITIONS** (specific body parts/components visible):
- **Head/Sensors Only**: +4 Defense, Perception Check Difficulty 15
- **Weapon Ports Only**: +3 Defense, can only target weapons
- **Extremities Only**: +2 Defense, limited damage potential

### Concealment Types & Effects

**LIGHT CONCEALMENT** (-1 to enemy attack rolls)
- *Personal*: Dim lighting, rain, light smoke
- *Vehicle+*: Sensor static, electromagnetic interference
- **Perception**: +2 Difficulty to initial detection

**HEAVY CONCEALMENT** (-2 to enemy attack rolls)
- *Personal*: Heavy smoke, darkness, thick fog
- *Vehicle+*: Dense dust cloud, sensor jamming, solar interference
- **Perception**: +4 Difficulty to initial detection

**TOTAL CONCEALMENT** (Cannot target visually)
- *Personal*: Complete darkness, opaque smoke screen
- *Vehicle+*: Dense nebula, total sensor blackout
- **Perception**: Must use alternative detection methods

### Stealth & Cloaking Systems

**PERSONAL STEALTH**:
- **Camouflage**: +4 Difficulty when stationary, +2 when moving slowly
- **Optical Camo**: +6 Difficulty, requires power, -2 when moving
- **Phase Cloak**: +8 Difficulty, exotic technology, massive power drain

**VEHICLE+ STEALTH**:
- **Stealth Coating**: +2 Difficulty to sensor detection
- **Active Camo**: +4 Difficulty, power drain, reduced when maneuvering
- **Cloaking Device**: +6 Difficulty, cannot fire while cloaked
- **Phase Shield**: +8 Difficulty, exotic tech, cannot interact while phased

### Stealth Compromise Events

**Automatic Detection** occurs when:
- **Attacking**: Reveals position immediately (lose stealth for 1 round)
- **High Energy**: Using powerful systems/weapons breaks stealth
- **Physical Contact**: Touching objects/targets reveals position
- **System Failure**: Critical failures expose stealth systems

### Cross-Scale Line-of-Sight

**SCALE-SPECIFIC LOS RULES**:

**Personal to Vehicle+**: Vehicle+ targets are Easy to Spot (Difficulty 8), Personal figures are Hard to Spot from Vehicle+ (Difficulty 15)

**Vehicle to Starship+**: Starship+ targets Automatic Detection at Short range, Vehicle-scale targets require Sensor Lock (Difficulty 12)

**Cross-Scale Stealth**: Stealth bonuses reduced by 2 per scale size difference

### Detection Range Scaling

**Maximum Detection Range** by scale and sensor quality:

| Scale | Basic Sensors | Advanced Sensors | Elite Sensors |
|-------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Personal | Long Range | Extreme Range | Beyond Extreme |
| Vehicle | Extreme Range | 2x Extreme | 5x Extreme |
| Starship | 2x Extreme | 10x Extreme | System-wide |
| Capital | System-wide | Multi-system | Galactic |

**Energy**: Drained â Burning â System Cascade
**Electromagnetic**: Distracted â Disrupted â System Failure
**Exotic**: Any effect (unpredictable results)

### Duration & Recovery System

**Duration Categories**:
- **Instantaneous**: Lasts until end of current turn
- **Short**: Lasts 1-3 rounds
- **Extended**: Lasts rest of scene/encounter
- **Permanent**: Requires repair/medical attention

**Recovery Mechanics**:
- **Natural Recovery**: Some effects fade automatically
- **Active Recovery**: Spend actions to remove effects using appropriate skills
- **Power Through**: Spend Willpower/Power Points to ignore effect for 1 round

## System Integration & Balance

### Mathematical Balance Check

With 2d10 + Attribute (1-5) + Skill (1-5) + Equipment (1-5) + Modifications (0-3):
- **Minimum Roll**: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5
- **Maximum Roll**: 20 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 38
- **Typical Competent Character**: 2d10 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 11-31 range

### Cross-Scale Combat Integration

When attacks cross scale boundaries:
- **Â±2 hit modifier per scale difference**
- **Status effects scale dramatically** (Capital vs Personal = automatic Critical conditions)
- **Damage scaling** maintains tactical relevance

### Environmental Integration Support

System supports various environmental conditions:
- **Zero-G**: Movement restrictions, recoil effects
- **Atmospheric Conditions**: Range and damage modifiers
- **Terrain Effects**: Cover availability, movement costs
- **Space Environments**: Sensor limitations, unique hazards
