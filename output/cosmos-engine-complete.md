# Cosmos Engine RPG
## Science Fiction Roleplaying from Street Level to Cosmic Legend

*A complete game system for epic science fiction adventures*

---


\newpage

# Chapter 1: Welcome to Cosmos Engine

## What is Cosmos Engine?

Cosmos Engine is a science fiction tabletop roleplaying game that scales seamlessly from intimate character-driven stories to galaxy-spanning conflicts. Using a unified 2d10 resolution system, players can explore any type of science fiction narrative - from the crew of a small trading vessel navigating political intrigue to massive fleets clashing in wars that determine the fate of civilizations.

### Core Features

**Unified Mechanics**: Every action, from picking a lock to commanding a fleet, uses the same core 2d10 + Attribute + Skill system.

**Scalable Gameplay**: Four integrated scales of play:
- **Personal Scale**: Individual characters and their actions
- **Vehicle Scale**: Ground and atmospheric vehicles
- **Starship Scale**: Spacecraft and their crews
- **Mass Combat Scale**: Armies, fleets, and massive conflicts

**Modular Design**: Use only the scales you need. Run a personal-scale game like Firefly, add starships for The Expanse-style adventures, or include everything for epic Star Wars-scale campaigns.

**Player Agency**: Characters remain meaningful at every scale. A single hero can influence the outcome of massive battles through leadership, special missions, or crucial actions.

## What is Roleplaying?

In a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG), you and your friends collaborate to tell an interactive story. One player takes the role of Game Master (GM), describing the universe and playing all the supporting characters. The other players each control a single protagonist - their player character (PC) - making decisions and rolling dice to determine outcomes.

Unlike a book or movie, no one knows exactly how the story will unfold. The GM presents situations, players decide how their characters respond, and dice determine success or failure. The result is a unique narrative that emerges from your collective creativity.

## The Science Fiction Sandbox

Cosmos Engine provides tools to explore any science fiction setting you can imagine:

**Hard Science Fiction**: Focus on realistic technology, physics constraints, and the challenges of space exploration. Every decision has weight, resources are limited, and the universe follows consistent rules.

**Space Opera**: Epic adventures with faster-than-light travel, alien civilizations, and galaxy-spanning conflicts. Heroes shape the fate of entire star systems through courage and determination.

**Cyberpunk**: Dive into dystopian futures where technology and humanity clash. Navigate corporate intrigue, hack reality itself, and decide what it means to be human in a digital age.

**Military SF**: Lead squads through desperate battles, command fleets in massive engagements, or wage guerrilla warfare against overwhelming odds. Strategy and tactics determine survival.

**Cosmic Horror**: Confront incomprehensible alien entities and existential threats. Knowledge comes at the cost of sanity, and victory often means merely surviving with your humanity intact.

**Post-Apocalyptic**: Explore the ruins of fallen civilizations, scavenge ancient technology, and rebuild in the shadow of a cosmic catastrophe. Every discovery could be salvation or doom.

## Using This Book

This book is organized to teach you Cosmos Engine step by step:

**Part I (Chapters 1-2)** introduces the game and its core mechanics. Start here to understand how everything works.

**Part II (Chapters 3-4)** covers character creation and advancement. Players should read these chapters to build their heroes.

**Part III (Chapters 5-7)** details personal-scale play: actions, combat, skills, and equipment. Everyone should be familiar with these rules.

**Part IV (Chapters 8-10)** explores advanced systems: starships, electronic warfare, and faster-than-light travel. Use these when your campaign expands beyond personal adventures.

**Part V (Chapters 11-13)** provides Game Master tools and guidance. GMs should read these chapters to run engaging campaigns.

**Part VI (Chapters 14-16)** presents optional systems like mass combat and cosmic horror. Add these when they enhance your story.

## Example of Play

*Sarah (GM), Alex (playing Captain Chen), Brook (playing Dr. Vasquez), and Casey (playing Zara the pilot) are exploring a derelict space station.*

**Sarah (GM)**: The airlock hisses open, revealing a corridor lit only by emergency strips along the floor. The walls are covered in what looks like frost, but it glimmers with an oily sheen. What do you do?

**Alex (Captain Chen)**: I motion for the team to hold position while I scan with my multi-spectrum analyzer. Any life signs or energy readings?

**Sarah**: Roll your Awareness plus Tech.

**Alex**: *rolls 2d10* I got a 7 and a 4, plus my Awareness of 6 and Tech skill of 3... that's 20 total.

**Sarah**: Your scanner goes haywire for a moment, displaying impossible readings - energy signatures that exist in eleven dimensions. Then it stabilizes. You detect faint power in the station's core and... something moving three sections ahead. The signature doesn't match anything in your database.

**Brook (Dr. Vasquez)**: "Captain, that frost... may I?" I want to carefully collect a sample without touching it directly.

**Casey (Zara)**: While the doc does that, I'm checking our six and looking for alternate routes. This corridor feels like a killbox.

**Sarah**: Good instincts. Zara, roll Awareness plus Survival to assess tactical threats.

**Casey**: *rolls* 15 total.

**Sarah**: You notice the corridor has no cover and the emergency lighting creates regular blind spots. Worse, you spot scratch marks on the ceiling - something with claws has been moving through here, and recently. Dr. Vasquez, roll Intellect plus Science for your sample collection.

**Brook**: *rolls* That's... a critical failure. Two 1s.

**Sarah**: As you extend your sampling tool, the "frost" suddenly moves, flowing up the tool toward your hand like living mercury. Roll a Resolve save, TN 14, or drop the tool reflexively.

**Brook**: *rolls* 16! I maintain my grip.

**Sarah**: You hold steady as the substance reaches your gloved hand and stops, pulsing with a faint bioluminescent glow. Through your suit's haptic feedback, you feel it's surprisingly warm. Your suit's quarantine alarm begins chirping.

**Alex**: "Everyone back to the ship. Now. We're not equipped for this."

**Sarah**: As you start to retreat, the movement on your scanner suddenly shifts direction - heading toward you at increasing speed. The station's lights flicker and die. In the darkness, you hear a sound like breaking glass mixed with whale song. Roll for initiative...

*This example demonstrates core mechanics (2d10 + Attribute + Skill), multiple skill applications, critical failures creating complications, and how player choices drive the narrative forward.*

## Your First Session

When you sit down for your first game of Cosmos Engine:

1. **Discuss the Campaign**: What kind of science fiction story excites everyone? Establish boundaries and expectations using the safety tools in Chapter 11.

2. **Create Characters**: Work through Chapter 3 together. Build connections between characters - why are they working together?

3. **Start Small**: Begin with personal-scale adventures. You can always add starships and larger conflicts later.

4. **Learn Together**: Don't worry about getting every rule right. The core mechanic (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs Target Number) will carry you through most situations.

5. **Embrace the Unknown**: Science fiction thrives on discovery. Let your curiosity drive the story forward.

## Welcome to the Cosmos

Whether you're smuggling cargo past imperial blockades, uncovering conspiracies that span star systems, fighting to preserve humanity against cosmic horrors, or exploring the mysteries of the universe, Cosmos Engine provides the tools to tell your story.

The cosmos awaits. What will you discover among the stars?

# Chapter 2: Core Mechanics

## The 2d10 System

At the heart of Cosmos Engine lies a simple, unified resolution mechanic:

**Basic Roll**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers vs Target Number (TN)

When you attempt something with an uncertain outcome, the GM sets a Target Number based on the task's difficulty. You roll two ten-sided dice, add your relevant attribute and skill, apply any situational modifiers, and compare the total to the TN. Equal or exceed it, and you succeed. Fall short, and you fail.

### Reading the Dice

When you roll 2d10, you add both dice together for a result from 2 to 20. The probability curve means results cluster around 11, making average tasks achievable for competent characters while preserving dramatic swings for critical moments.

**Special Rolls**:
- **Natural 20** (two 10s): Critical Success
- **Natural 2** (two 1s): Critical Failure
- **Doubles**: Extreme results (very good or very bad)

## Attributes (PRIMAC)

Every character possesses six primary attributes rated from 1 to 10:

### Presence (PRE)
Your force of personality, leadership capability, and social impact. Presence measures how well you influence others, project confidence, and navigate social situations.
- **Key Uses**: Leadership, persuasion, intimidation, performance
- **Saving Throw**: Resist social manipulation, maintain composure

### Resolve (RES)
Your mental fortitude, willpower, and determination. Resolve represents your ability to persevere through adversity and maintain focus under pressure.
- **Key Uses**: Concentration, resistance to fear, mental endurance
- **Saving Throw**: Resist mental effects, maintain sanity

### Intellect (INT)
Your reasoning ability, memory, and analytical thinking. Intellect measures how quickly you learn, solve problems, and understand complex concepts.
- **Key Uses**: Investigation, technology, medicine, tactics
- **Saving Throw**: Recognize illusions, solve puzzles quickly

### Might (MIG)
Your physical strength and power. Might determines how much you can lift, how hard you hit, and your raw physical presence.
- **Key Uses**: Melee combat, lifting, breaking objects, athletics
- **Saving Throw**: Resist physical effects, break free from restraints

### Awareness (AWA)
Your perception, intuition, and connection to your surroundings. Awareness helps you notice details, react quickly, and sense danger.
- **Key Uses**: Initiative, perception, ranged combat, piloting
- **Saving Throw**: Avoid surprise, detect ambushes

### Coordination (COO)
Your agility, dexterity, and precise motor control. Coordination affects your accuracy, balance, and ability to perform delicate tasks.
- **Key Uses**: Ranged attacks, defense, stealth, technical work
- **Saving Throw**: Avoid physical hazards, maintain balance

### Attribute Scale

**1-3**: Below Average - Deficiency in this area
**4-5**: Average - Normal human capability
**6-7**: Above Average - Natural talent
**8-9**: Exceptional - Among the best
**10**: Legendary - Peak human ability

### Using Attributes

Attributes provide the foundation for all actions:
- **Attribute Only**: For raw, untrained efforts (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **With Skills**: Combined with training (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs TN)
- **Saving Throws**: Reactive defense (2d10 + Attribute vs TN)
- **Contests**: Opposed rolls (highest total wins)

## Skills Overview

Skills represent specialized training and experience. Unlike attributes, skills start at 0 and improve through advancement points.

### Skill Ratings
- **0**: Untrained (rely on attribute alone)
- **1-2**: Novice (basic training)
- **3-4**: Professional (competent practitioner)
- **5-6**: Expert (highly skilled)
- **7-8**: Master (renowned specialist)
- **9-10**: Legendary (best in the galaxy)

### Core Skills

**Combat** (Might or Coordination): Armed and unarmed fighting
**Pilot** (Awareness or Coordination): Vehicle and starship operation
**Tech** (Intellect): Computers, electronics, and engineering
**Social** (Presence): Persuasion, deception, and etiquette
**Survival** (Awareness or Resolve): Endurance and wilderness skills
**Stealth** (Coordination): Moving unseen and unheard
**Medicine** (Intellect): Healing and biological sciences
**Investigation** (Intellect or Awareness): Research and deduction

*Full skill descriptions appear in Chapter 6*

## Basic Task Resolution

### Setting Target Numbers

The GM sets Target Numbers based on task difficulty:

| Difficulty | TN | Example |
|------------|----|---------| 
| Trivial | 8 | Notice something obvious |
| Easy | 11 | Pick a simple lock |
| Moderate | 14 | Pilot through debris field |
| Hard | 17 | Hack military encryption |
| Extreme | 20 | Perform emergency surgery in zero-g |
| Legendary | 23 | Outsmart an AI |
| Impossible | 26 | Bend reality through will alone |

### Resolution Process

1. **Player Declares Intent**: "I want to hack into the security system"
2. **GM Sets Difficulty**: "That's a Hard task, TN 17"
3. **Determine Attribute + Skill**: Intellect + Tech
4. **Apply Modifiers**: +2 for specialized tools
5. **Roll 2d10**: Results: 6 and 5 = 11
6. **Calculate Total**: 11 + 6 (INT) + 4 (Tech) + 2 (tools) = 23
7. **Compare to TN**: 23 vs 17 = Success by 6

### Margins of Success and Failure

The difference between your result and the TN determines the degree of success or failure:

**Success Margins**:
- **0-2**: Marginal Success - You barely succeed
- **3-5**: Solid Success - Clear accomplishment  
- **6-9**: Critical Success - Exceptional result
- **10+**: Legendary Success - Perfect execution

**Failure Margins**:
- **1-2**: Marginal Failure - Almost succeeded
- **3-5**: Clear Failure - Definitely didn't work
- **6-9**: Critical Failure - Things go wrong
- **10+**: Catastrophic Failure - Disaster strikes

## Advantage & Disadvantage

Sometimes circumstances make tasks easier or harder:

### Advantage
Roll 3d10 and use the best two dice:
- Superior equipment
- Assistance from others
- Ideal conditions
- Spending resources

### Disadvantage
Roll 3d10 and use the worst two dice:
- Inferior tools
- Environmental hazards
- Distractions
- Working under pressure

### Multiple Factors
Advantages and disadvantages cancel each other out. If multiple factors apply, use the strongest single effect.

## Critical Success & Failure

### Critical Success (Natural 20)
When you roll two 10s:
- Automatic success regardless of TN
- Maximum possible effect
- Additional beneficial outcome
- Possible permanent advantage

**Examples**:
- Combat: Maximum damage + special effect
- Social: NPC becomes lasting ally
- Tech: Permanent system access gained
- Pilot: Impossible maneuver achieved

### Critical Failure (Natural 2)
When you roll two 1s:
- Automatic failure regardless of modifiers
- Complication introduced
- Possible equipment damage
- Temporary disadvantage

**Examples**:
- Combat: Weapon jams or breaks
- Social: Major faux pas, reputation damaged
- Tech: System locks you out permanently
- Pilot: Minor collision or system failure

## Time and Actions

### Time Scales

Cosmos Engine uses flexible time scales:

**Narrative Time**: For exploration and roleplay
- No formal tracking
- Actions take realistic time
- GM describes passage of time

**Scene Time**: For dramatic situations
- Roughly 10-30 minutes game time
- Multiple actions per character
- Used for investigations, social encounters

**Round Time**: For combat and action scenes
- 6 seconds per round
- Formal initiative order
- Specific action economy

### Action Types

During round time, each character can take:

**1 Standard Action**:
- Make an attack
- Full skill use
- Complex maneuver

**1 Move Action**:
- Move your Speed in meters
- Stand from prone
- Draw/sheathe weapon

**Unlimited Quick Actions**:
- Speak
- Drop an item
- Simple gestures

**Unlimited Free Actions**:
- Maintain concentration
- Observe surroundings

## Scale System

Cosmos Engine uses four interconnected scales:

### Personal Scale
Individual characters taking individual actions:
- Base scale for all mechanics
- 1 meter = 1 meter
- 1 round = 6 seconds
- Damage affects individuals

### Vehicle Scale
Ground and air vehicles:
- 10 meters = 1 vehicle unit
- Same time scale as personal
- Vehicle weapons vs people: +6 damage

### Starship Scale  
Spacecraft and space stations:
- 1 kilometer = 1 space unit
- Same 6-second rounds
- Starship weapons vs vehicles: +6 damage

### Mass Combat Scale
Military units and fleet battles:
- Abstract unit representation
- 10-minute battle rounds
- Strategic rather than tactical

### Cross-Scale Interactions

**Scale Difference Penalties**:
- 1 scale difference: -3 to hit
- 2 scale differences: -6 to hit
- 3 scale differences: Generally impossible

**Damage Scaling**:
- Higher scale to lower: +6 damage per scale
- Lower scale to higher: -6 damage per scale

## Assistance and Group Efforts

### Simple Assistance
One character helps another:
- Helper rolls their check
- Success grants +2 to primary actor
- Critical success grants +3
- Failure provides no benefit
- Critical failure imposes -1

### Skilled Assistance
When helper has relevant skill:
- Must have skill 3+ to provide skilled help
- Helper rolls vs TN 11
- Success grants +2 (or +3 on critical)
- Can explain approach for better bonus

### Group Efforts
Multiple characters working together:
- Designate primary actor
- Each helper who succeeds adds +1
- Maximum bonus: +5
- Critical failures create complications

## Doubles and Extreme Results

When both dice show the same number, results become more extreme:

**High Doubles** (6-6 through 10-10):
- Emphasize success dramatically
- Add narrative flourish
- Possible reputation gain
- May inspire allies

**Middle Doubles** (3-3 through 5-5):
- Solid, reliable results
- Things go exactly as planned
- No surprises either way

**Low Doubles** (1-1 through 2-2):
- Emphasize failure memorably
- Add complications
- Possible reputation loss
- May demoralize allies

## Saving Throws

When reacting to danger, make a saving throw:

**Save Formula**: 2d10 + Attribute vs TN

**Common Saves**:
- **Might**: Resist poison, disease, physical transformation
- **Coordination**: Dodge explosions, avoid traps, maintain balance
- **Awareness**: Detect ambush, avoid surprise, react quickly
- **Intellect**: Recognize illusions, solve puzzles under pressure
- **Resolve**: Resist fear, maintain sanity, concentrate through pain
- **Presence**: Avoid social manipulation, maintain composure

### Save Target Numbers
- **Easy Save**: TN 11
- **Moderate Save**: TN 14
- **Hard Save**: TN 17
- **Extreme Save**: TN 20

## Skill Synergies

Sometimes multiple skills apply to a situation. Rather than stacking bonuses, use the most advantageous combination:

**Primary + Supporting**: Use the higher skill as primary, gain +1 if supporting skill is 3+

**Examples**:
- Tech + Medicine: Cybernetic surgery
- Pilot + Combat: Fighter dogfighting
- Social + Investigation: Interrogation
- Stealth + Tech: Security system bypass

## Extended Tasks

Some tasks require multiple successes over time:

**Complexity Levels**:
- Simple: 3 successes needed
- Moderate: 5 successes needed
- Complex: 8 successes needed
- Extreme: 12 successes needed

**Time per Check**: Varies by task
- Research: Hours or days
- Repairs: Minutes or hours
- Construction: Days or weeks

**Complications**: Critical failures remove one success or add complications

## Quick Resolution Guidelines

When in doubt:
1. **Is success uncertain?** If not, don't roll
2. **What's the approach?** Determine attribute + skill
3. **How hard is it?** Set TN (default to Moderate: 14)
4. **What are the stakes?** Know consequences before rolling
5. **How well did they do?** Use margin for narrative color

- **Wounded** (74-50%): -1 to all actions
- **Injured** (49-25%): -2 to all actions
- **Critical** (24-1%): -3 to all actions
- **Dying** (0 or less): Unconscious, requires immediate aid

### Defense Values (Balanced System)

**Physical Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill √∑ 2) + Cover + Armor
- Base examples (Combat 3, no cover/armor):
  - Coordination 3: 10 + 3 + 2 = 15 Defense
  - Coordination 5: 10 + 5 + 2 = 17 Defense  
  - Coordination 7: 10 + 7 + 2 = 19 Defense

- **Might Save**: 2d10 + Might vs TN
- **Coordination Save**: 2d10 + Coordination vs TN
- **Awareness Save**: 2d10 + Awareness vs TN
- **Intellect Save**: 2d10 + Intellect vs TN
- **Resolve Save**: 2d10 + Resolve vs TN
- **Presence Save**: 2d10 + Presence vs TN

## Step 6: Choose Specializations

## Character Creation Example

**Sarah creates Zara Chen, a pilot:**

**Concept**: Former military pilot who discovered her squadron was transporting kidnapped colonists. Went AWOL, now flies for whoever opposes the corrupt military-industrial complex.

**Species**: Synaptic - Her enhanced reflexes and quick thinking made her an ace pilot, though her small stature sometimes causes others to underestimate her.

**Attributes** (30 points):
- Might: 3 (0 points, -2 from species = 1)
- Coordination: 5 (4 points, +2 from species = 7)
- Awareness: 6 (7 points)
- Intellect: 5 (4 points, +1 from species = 6)
- Resolve: 5 (4 points, -1 from species = 4)
- Presence: 4 (2 points)
- Total spent: 21 points (9 points saved for skills)

**Skills** (27 + 9 saved = 36 points):
- Pilot: 5 (15 points) - Primary skill
- Combat: 3 (6 points) - Military training
- Tech: 3 (6 points) - Ship maintenance
- Athletics: 2 (3 points) - Acrobatic in zero-G
- Survival: 2 (3 points) - Military training
- Stealth: 2 (3 points) - Small size helps
- Investigation: 0 (0 points)
- Social: 0 (0 points)

**Derived Values** (Balanced System):
- HP: 40 + (1√ó8) + (4√ó4) = 64 (fragile but quick)
- Defense: 10 + 7 + (3√∑2) + 1 (size) = 19 (high due to combat training)
- Speed: 6 + 7 = 13 meters (very fast)
- Initiative: 7 + 6 + 1d10 = 13-23 (excellent reflexes)
- Attack (Ranged): 2d10 + 7 + (3√∑2) = 2d10 + 9
- Damage (Autopistol): 1d8 + (3√∑2) = 1d8 + 2

**Species Abilities**:
- Size provides +1 Defense
- +2 Initiative from enhanced reflexes
- Can take one extra Quick action per round
- High metabolism: Requires double food intake

**Specialization**: Ace Pilot (reroll failed Pilot checks once per scene)

**Equipment**: Gear package
- Light combat armor (fitted for small frame)
- Autopistol (lightweight model)
- Pilot's kit with custom controls
- Personal shuttle access
- High-calorie ration packs
- 5,000 credits

**Motivation**: Justice - Stop military from exploiting colonists
**Goal**: Expose General Morrison's trafficking ring
**Fear**: Being trapped in a confined space where speed won't help

**Connections**:
- Strong Bond: Marcus (Brook's character) - saved her when she crashed
- Working Relationship: Captain Vex (Gravitae engineer) - maintains her ship

Zara's quick reflexes and fearless piloting make her invaluable to any crew willing to fight injustice!

- Use scale differences creatively

**Mentorship**: Experienced help novices
- Teaching grants small AP rewards
- Creates character bonds
- Maintains group cohesion

**Differential Advancement**: Balance over time
- Newer characters advance faster initially
- Veterans gain other benefits (contacts, resources)
- Focus on different advancement types

## Advancement Example

**Sarah's character Zara after 10 sessions**:

Starting: Pilot 5, Combat 3, Tech 2
Earned: 25 AP (10 sessions + milestones)

Spending:
- Combat 3‚Üí4: 40 AP (saved 15 AP from creation)
- Basic Specialization "Ace Pilot": 50 AP (saved)
- Remaining: 0 AP

Zara can now reroll failed Pilot checks once per scene and has improved her combat abilities. Sarah plans to save for advancing Tech next, wanting to maintain her own ship.

## Quick Advancement Option

For faster progression:

# Chapter 5: Actions and Skills

Skills represent your character's training, experience, and expertise in various fields. Combined with attributes, they determine your effectiveness at tasks throughout the cosmos. This chapter details how skills work, what each skill covers, and how to use them in play.

## Skill Basics

### Using Skills

**Basic Skill Check**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers vs Target Number

When attempting a task with uncertain outcome:
1. GM determines which skill applies
2. Player chooses appropriate attribute pairing
3. GM sets Target Number based on difficulty
4. Roll dice and compare to TN

### Skill Ratings

Skills range from 0 (untrained) to 10 (legendary mastery):

| Rating | Level | Description | Availability |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | Untrained | No formal training, rely on attribute alone | Always |
| 1-2 | Novice | Basic training or casual experience | Character creation |
| 3-4 | Professional | Competent practitioner, can make a living | Character creation |
| 5 | Expert | Highly skilled, starting maximum | Character creation limit |
| 6-7 | Master | Among the best in the sector | Advancement only |
| 8-9 | Legendary | Galaxy-renowned, pushing boundaries | Advancement only |
| 10 | Transcendent | Reality-defying capability | Advancement only |

**Skill Advancement**: Skills above 5 can only be gained through play using Advancement Points (see Chapter 4). This represents the experience and training that comes from actual use rather than initial education.

### Attribute Pairings

Most skills have a primary attribute but can pair with others for specific applications:

**Combat + Might**: Melee attacks, breaking objects
**Combat + Coordination**: Ranged attacks, quick draws
**Combat + Awareness**: Tactical assessment, ambush detection
**Combat + Intellect**: Analyzing fighting styles, planning battles

The GM determines which pairing fits the situation, or players can suggest creative applications.

# Chapter 10: Electronic Warfare and Hacking

In an age of ubiquitous computing and networked systems, the digital battlefield is as important as physical space. This chapter covers hacking, cybersecurity, electronic warfare, and the tools that turn information into power across all scales of conflict.

## Hacking Fundamentals

### Digital Infiltration

Hacking represents the art of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, and digital infrastructure. Unlike simple Technology checks, hacking involves ongoing infiltration, stealth, and cyber-combat.

**Basic Hacking Process**:
1. **Target Identification**: Find systems to infiltrate
2. **Access Attempt**: Breach initial security
3. **Network Navigation**: Move through system zones
4. **Goal Achievement**: Complete objectives
5. **Extraction**: Escape without detection

### Core Mechanics

| 3-4 | Level 3-4 | Level 5-6 | Level 7+ |
| 5-6 | Level 5-6 | Level 7-8 | Level 9+ |
| 7-8 | Level 7-8 | Level 9-10 | Level 11+ |
| 9-10 | Level 9-10 | Level 11-12 | Level 13+ |
| 11-12 | Level 11-12 | Level 13-14 | Level 15+ |
| 13-14 | Level 13-14 | Level 15-16 | Level 17+ |
| 15-16 | Level 15-16 | Level 17-18 | Level 19+ |
| 17-18 | Level 17-18 | Level 19-20 | Level 20+ |
| 19-20 | Level 19-20 | Level 20+ | Legendary |
