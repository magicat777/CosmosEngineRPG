# Cosmos Engine Setting Framework

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine RPG is designed to support any science fiction setting while providing optional framework elements that Game Masters can adopt, adapt, or ignore as needed. This guide presents flexible setting components that work across all technology eras and campaign scales.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Modular elements that can be mixed and matched
- Technology-neutral concepts that scale across eras
- Cultural and political frameworks without specific details
- Foundation for GM creativity rather than rigid canon
- Integration with all Cosmos Engine game mechanics
