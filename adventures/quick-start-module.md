## ADVENTURE BACKGROUND

### The Setup
**Research Station Kepler-442b** is a small scientific outpost studying potentially habitable planets. Three days ago, all communication ceased. The station's corporate sponsor, **Heisenberg Industries**, has hired the characters to investigate and restore contact.

### What Really Happened
1. **Day 1**: Station detected artificial signals from the planet below
2. **Day 2**: **Dr. James Wright** began unauthorized contact attempts
3. **Day 3**: Alien probe arrived, causing systems malfunctions
4. **Present**: Station crew in medical emergency, alien probe analyzing station

### The Truth
The signals come from an ancient alien monitoring system. Dr. Wright's contact attempts triggered a probe launch to investigate humanity. The probe is peaceful but its advanced technology is incompatible with human systems, causing dangerous feedback.

---

## SCENE 6: FIRST CONTACT RESOLUTION

### Successful Communication
If characters establish communication, the probe responds with mathematical sequences and star charts. It conveys:

1. **Ancient Origin**: Probe is from monitoring system millions of years old
2. **Purpose**: Triggered by Dr. Wright's signals to assess human intelligence
3. **Peaceful Intent**: Scanning for knowledge, not conquest
4. **Problem**: Human neural systems incompatible with probe scanning
5. **Solution**: Probe will modify scanning frequency to prevent harm

### Communication Success Outcomes
**Basic Success**: Probe stops harmful scanning, crew begins to recover
**Critical Success**: Probe shares star map of other intelligent species

### The Choice
The probe offers humanity a choice:
- **Isolation**: Probe reports humans not ready for galactic community
- **Contact**: Probe reports humans ready, galactic community will know of Earth
- **Learning**: Probe shares basic knowledge but delays formal contact

**This is a group decision requiring roleplay and discussion**

---

## SCENE 7: COMPLICATIONS

### If Combat Was Chosen
Attacking the probe triggers its defensive systems:

**Combat Encounter**:
- Probe uses energy shield (Defense 20)
- Probe attacks with EM pulse: 2d10+5 vs Defense, stuns for 1d6 rounds
- Probe has 50 HP but attacking it alerts alien monitoring system
- **Resolution**: Eventually probe retreats, but sends warning signal to its masters

### Corporate Interference
Halfway through first contact, **Heisenberg Corporate Security** arrives with orders to secure alien technology.

**Security Team Leader - Captain Morrison**:
- Combat 5, Command 4, Social 3
- Orders: Secure alien tech, classify encounter
- Motivation: Corporate profit and control

**Conflict Options**:
1. **Convince Morrison**: Social TN 17 to explain situation
2. **Legal Authority**: Investigation TN 14 to find jurisdictional issues
3. **Technical Sabotage**: Technology TN 17 to disable corporate ship
4. **Direct Confrontation**: Combat encounter

### Time Pressure
The alien probe will only wait 30 minutes for humanity's decision before departing. Corporate interference and other complications create urgency.

---

## SCENE 8: RESOLUTION

### Mission Success Conditions
**Primary Success**: Crew rescued and communication restored
**Secondary Success**: First contact handled peacefully
**Tertiary Success**: Corporate interference resolved without violence

### Possible Endings

#### The Diplomatic Solution
Characters convince both aliens and corporate forces to cooperate. Result: Controlled first contact with corporate oversight but peaceful intentions.

#### The Scientific Solution
Characters focus on understanding and learning. Result: Knowledge exchange established, formal contact delayed until humanity is more prepared.

#### The Independent Solution
Characters make contact independent of corporate control. Result: Personal relationship with aliens, potential corporate opposition in future.

#### The Military Solution
Characters resort to force against either aliens or corporation. Result: First contact becomes confrontational, future complications likely.

### Character Rewards
**Experience Points**: 5-8 AP based on creative problem solving
**Equipment**: Access to advanced technology from probe or corporation
**Contacts**: Relationship with Dr. Vasquez, possibly alien probe AI
**Reputation**: Known as first contact team (positive or negative)
