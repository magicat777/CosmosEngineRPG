## Signature Techniques

### "I Thought What I'd Do Was, I'd Pretend I Was One of Those Deaf-Mutes"
Once per scene, completely rewrite one minute of everyone's perception in network range. What they saw, heard, and remember changes to my narrative.

### "The Laughing Man Incident"
Grandmaster Technique: Once per session, become a living meme. For one scene, I exist everywhere data flows, can act through any networked device, and inspire countless copycats to act in my name.

### "Corporate Terrorism Through Truth"
Turn any organization's own data against them. All their secrets become public, all their lies exposed, all their security becomes their vulnerability.
