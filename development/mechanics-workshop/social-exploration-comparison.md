## Detailed Analysis

### Option 1: Influence & Discovery Points
**Strengths**:
- Creates currency players can strategize with
- Natural specialization progression (generate more, spend less)
- Easily scales (personal favor → galactic treaty)
- Can integrate with other systems (spend IP in combat for allies)

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires tracking two new resources
- Needs refresh/banking rules
- Point costs need balancing

**Best For**: Campaigns with political intrigue, exploration focus, player agency

### Option 2: Narrative Stakes
**Strengths**:
- Zero new tracking
- Very simple to explain
- Dramatic tension built-in
- Fast resolution

**Weaknesses**:
- Less specialization depth
- Harder to scale mechanically
- GM needs to improvise consequences

**Best For**: Narrative-focused games, quick resolution, new players

### Option 3: Approach-Based
**Strengths**:
- Uses existing PRIMAC system well
- Encourages creative problem-solving
- No new resources to track
- Character personality shines through

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires GM to assign vulnerabilities
- Can feel arbitrary without good examples
- Less obvious progression path

**Best For**: Character-driven stories, diverse parties, role-playing focus

### Option 4: Clock System  
**Strengths**:
- Visual progress tracking
- Great for group efforts
- Tension builds naturally
- Works for any scale

**Weaknesses**:
- Most complex option
- Requires physical/digital tracking
- Can feel "gamey"

**Best For**: Complex heists, long-term projects, visible progress

## Integration Examples

### How Each Works with Combat

**IP/DP**: "Spend 3 IP to gain allied fire support"

**Stakes**: "Risky: I'll intimidate them AND they'll flee"

**Approaches**: "I'll Deceive them about our numbers"

**Clocks**: "Fill the 'Demoralize Enemy' 6-clock"

### How Each Scales

**Personal → Capital Scale**:

**IP/DP**: 
- Personal: 1 IP = Guard looks away
- Capital: 100 IP = Trade agreement

**Stakes**:
- Personal: Desperate = Join our crew
- Capital: Desperate = Alliance treaty

**Approaches**:
- Personal: Intimidate with Might
- Capital: Intimidate with fleet presence

**Clocks**:
- Personal: 4-clock "Convince Merchant"
- Capital: 12-clock "Negotiate Peace"

## Skill Tree Potential

**Deepest Trees**: IP/DP (currency manipulation)
**Most Flexible**: Approaches (signature moves)
**Simplest Trees**: Stakes (penalty reduction)
**Most Visual**: Clocks (segment manipulation)

## Final Recommendation

For Cosmos Engine's design goals:
1. **Primary**: Influence & Discovery Points
2. **Alternative**: Approach-Based System
3. **Hybrid Option**: Use IP/DP as base, add Approaches as ways to generate bonus points

The IP/DP system best supports:
- Specialization over generalization
- Cross-scale consistency  
- Technology integration
- Player agency
- Meaningful advancement
