# Cosmos Engine Drift Analysis Report
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Analyst**: System Review  
**Scope**: All existing documentation

## Executive Summary

Overall system health: **GOOD** ‚úÖ
- Core mechanics well-defined and consistent
- Minor intentional drifts documented
- One major gap: Attribute system undefined

## Detailed Analysis by System

### 1. Core Resolution System ‚úÖ
**Files Reviewed**: 
- `system_summary.md`
- `cosmos_engine_technical_guide.md`
- `rpg_technical_dice_mechanic_guide.md`

**Compliance**: 100%
- Uses 2d10 consistently
- Four modifier types maintained
- Caps respected (+8/-6)
- TNs within range (8-20)

**No drift detected**

### 2. Combat System ‚úÖ
**Files Reviewed**:
- `cosmos_combat_streamlined.md`
- `cosmos_combat_guide_advanced_v2.md`

**Identified Variances**:

#### Initiative (Intentional Simplification)
- Uses: 2d10 + Reaction + Agility
- Missing: Equipment and Situation modifiers
- **Assessment**: Acceptable drift for speed of play

#### Damage System (Intentional Variance)
- Uses: Polyhedral dice (d4-d20)
- Not: 2d10 resolution
- **Assessment**: Appropriate since damage isn't pass/fail

#### Status Effects (Aligned)
- Three categories as designed
- Binary application (one per category)
- No complexity creep detected

**Overall**: Well-aligned with intentional variances

### 3. Character System ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Files Reviewed**:
- `cosmos_character_system.md`
- `cosmos_advantage_system.md`

**Critical Gap**:
- **Attributes Undefined**: System references 6 attributes but doesn't define them
- This blocks several other systems
- Needs immediate attention

**Aligned Elements**:
- Skill ranges (0-5, enhanced to 7)
- Advancement Points system
- Specialization focus
- Technology Era integration

### 4. Scale System ‚úÖ
**Files Reviewed**: All combat and core documents

**Compliance**: 100%
- Four scales defined clearly
- Universal mechanics with scale modifiers
- No scale-specific resolution mechanics
- Cross-scale combat rules consistent

**No drift detected**

### 5. Technology System ‚úÖ
**Files Reviewed**: Multiple documents

**Compliance**: 100%
- Era limits respected (equipment +1 to +5)
- Enhancement modes consistent
- Power allocation within bounds
- No technology-specific resolution

**No drift detected**

## Undocumented Mechanics Found

### In Combat Advanced v2
1. **Boost Dice**: Mentioned but not fully integrated
2. **Assisted Actions**: Referenced but mechanics unclear
3. **Legendary Advantages**: Listed but not mechanically defined

**Recommendation**: Either fully develop or remove references

## Missing Systems

### Critical (Blocking)
1. **Attribute Definitions**: Which 6 attributes?
2. **Attribute Applications**: How used at each scale?

### Important (Gaps)
1. **Social/Exploration Mechanics**: No rules exist
2. **Equipment Catalogs**: No concrete items
3. **Advancement Examples**: No sample progressions

### Nice to Have
1. **Campaign Framework**: How to run games
2. **Setting Details**: Universe context
3. **GM Guidance**: Running the game

## Drift Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Core resolution
- Scale system  
- Technology framework

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Combat (watch complexity)
- Status effects (resist expansion)
- Specialization trees (balance careful)

### High Risk üî¥
- Undefined attributes (could cascade)
- Missing social system (might not align)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Define Attribute System**
   - Choose 6 attributes
   - Set applications
   - Integrate with skills

2. **Document Design Decisions**
   - Why these intentional drifts?
   - What alternatives rejected?

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Create social/exploration mechanics (2/10 complexity)
2. Build equipment catalogs with examples
3. Clean up advanced combat references

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. Playtest all systems together
2. Watch for emergent drift
3. Refine based on feedback

## Consistency Score

**Overall: 92/100**

Breakdown:
- Core Mechanics: 100/100
- Combat System: 95/100 (minor intentional drifts)
- Character System: 75/100 (missing attributes)
- Scale System: 100/100
- Technology System: 100/100
- Documentation: 90/100 (some gaps)

## Conclusion

The Cosmos Engine demonstrates strong mechanical consistency with well-reasoned intentional variances. The core 2d10 system is properly maintained throughout. The primary concern is the undefined attribute system, which should be addressed before further development.

The framework successfully achieves its design goals of tactical sci-fi gameplay without complexity overhead. Minor drifts (initiative, damage dice) enhance rather than detract from play.

**Recommendation**: Address attribute system immediately, then proceed with confidence in the solid mechanical foundation.
