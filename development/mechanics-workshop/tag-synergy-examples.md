# Tag Synergy System - Creating Depth Without Pages

## How Tags Work

### Basic Concept
- Each specialization grants 1-2 tags
- Tags are keywords that interact across skills
- Same tag from different sources = synergy bonus
- Different tags can combo for unique effects

## Tag Categories

### Action Tags (How you do things)
- **[Precise]** - Careful, accurate, measured
- **[Brutal]** - Overwhelming force, shock value
- **[Subtle]** - Unnoticed, indirect, hidden
- **[Reckless]** - Fast, dangerous, impressive

### Style Tags (Your approach)
- **[Tactical]** - Planning, coordination, efficiency
- **[Intuitive]** - Instinct, feeling, flow
- **[Technical]** - By-the-book, optimal, scientific
- **[Creative]** - Unconventional, innovative

### Domain Tags (Where you excel)
- **[Digital]** - Networks, AI, software
- **[Mechanical]** - Hardware, vehicles, devices
- **[Social]** - People, groups, cultures
- **[Enhancement]** - Augmentation, improvement

### Power Tags (Earned through mastery)
- **[Ace]** - Best of the best
- **[Leadership]** - Command and inspire
- **[Lethal]** - Death follows you
- **[Transcendent]** - Beyond normal limits

## Synergy Examples

### Double Tags (Same tag twice)
**[Ace] + [Ace]** = "True Ace"
- Reroll all 1s and 2s
- Your reputation opens doors
- Lesser pilots defer to you

**[Precise] + [Precise]** = "Perfect Precision"  
- Can't critically fail on careful actions
- +3 instead of +2 for aimed actions
- Notice details others miss

**[Digital] + [Digital]** = "Digital Native"
- Think at computer speed
- Access restricted networks
- AIs consider you kin

### Combo Tags (Different tags interact)
**[Brutal] + [Tactical]** = "Shock Doctrine"
- First brutal attack each combat stuns
- Intimidation affects groups
- Break morale efficiently

**[Subtle] + [Lethal]** = "Silent Death"
- Stealth kills leave no evidence
- Targets don't scream
- Blame falls elsewhere

**[Technical] + [Creative]** = "Mad Science"
- Break supposed limits
- Invent new applications
- "It shouldn't work, but..."

### Triple+ Combinations
**[Ace] + [Reckless] + [Leadership]** = "Maverick Squadron"
- Your whole unit gains daredevil benefits
- Inspire impossible performances
- "Follow me!" always works

**[Digital] + [Enhancement] + [Transcendent]** = "Singularity"
- Merge consciousness with networks
- Upgrade others remotely
- Exist in multiple places

## Character Build Examples

### "The Perfect Assassin"
**Skills**: Combat (Sniper) + Stealth (Ghost) + Tech (Infiltrator)
**Tags**: [Precise] [Patient] + [Subtle] [Invisible] + [Digital] [Subtle]
**Synergies**: 
- Double [Subtle] = Never detected
- [Precise] + [Patient] = Perfect shot
- [Digital] + [Invisible] = Erase from cameras

### "The Ace Squadron Leader"  
**Skills**: Pilot (Ace, Squadron Leader) + Combat (Tactical) + Leadership (Inspiring)
**Tags**: [Ace] [Ace] [Leadership] [Coordinated] + [Tactical] + [Leadership]
**Synergies**:
- Double [Ace] = Legendary pilot
- Double [Leadership] = Beloved commander
- [Tactical] + [Coordinated] = Perfect formations

### "The Transhumanist Hacker"
**Skills**: Tech (Hacker, Transhumanist, Ghost) + Medicine (Augmentation)
**Tags**: [Digital] [Digital] [Enhancement] [Radical] [Transcendent] + [Enhancement]
**Synergies**:
- Double [Digital] = One with networks
- Double [Enhancement] = Limitless augmentation
- [Radical] + [Transcendent] = Posthuman

## Print Efficiency Analysis

### Traditional Skill Trees
- Each combination needs documentation
- 10 skills with 10 options each = 100 entries
- Cross-skill interactions = exponential growth
- Result: 50+ pages easily

### Tag System
- ~30 tags total (1 page to define)
- Each skill lists which tags available (included in skill page)
- Synergy examples (1-2 pages)
- Players discover combinations
- Result: 2-3 extra pages for infinite depth

## GM Guidelines

### Approving Synergies
"Does this combination make narrative sense?"
- [Precise] + [Reckless] = No synergy (contradictory)
- [Brutal] + [Powerful] = Clear synergy
- [Digital] + [Mechanical] = Situational synergy

### Power Level
- 1 matching tag = Minor benefit
- 2 matching tags = Major benefit  
- 3+ matching tags = Signature ability
- Contradictory tags = Choose one or penalty

### Creating New Tags
Keep them:
- Broad enough to appear in multiple skills
- Specific enough to mean something
- Evocative of play style
- One word when possible

## Player Discovery Journal

Encourage players to track discovered synergies:

```
MY DISCOVERED SYNERGIES
Character: Maya the Fixer

[Social] + [Digital] = "Information Broker"
- Found in: Social (Network) + Tech (Hacker)
- Effect: Convert digital intel to social leverage
- Used when: Blackmailed the crime lord

[Creative] + [Intuitive] = "Outside the Box"  
- Found in: Tech (Jury Rigger) + Pilot (Emergency)
- Effect: Impossible solutions work more often
- Used when: Fixed the FTL with kitchen supplies
```

This creates a personalized "spell book" of combos!
