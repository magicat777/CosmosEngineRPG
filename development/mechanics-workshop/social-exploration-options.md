# Social/Exploration Mechanics Options for Cosmos Engine

**Design Target**: 2/10 complexity
**Core Principle**: Simple resolution with depth through specialization

## Option 1: Influence & Discovery Points (Recommended)

### Core Mechanic
Standard 2d10 + PRIMAC + Skill vs TN, but successes generate points:
- **Influence Points** (IP): Spent on social outcomes
- **Discovery Points** (DP): Spent on exploration benefits

### Social Encounters
**Basic Roll**: 2d10 + Presence/Intellect/Resolve + Social vs TN
- Success = 1 IP, +1 per 5 over TN
- Critical (Natural 20) = Double IP

**Spending Influence Points**:
- 1 IP: Minor favor, basic information
- 3 IP: Major favor, sensitive intel
- 5 IP: Lasting alliance, secret knowledge
- 10 IP: Faction-level influence

### Exploration System  
**Basic Roll**: 2d10 + Awareness/Intellect + Exploration vs TN
- Success = 1 DP, +1 per 5 over TN
- Critical = Find something extraordinary

**Spending Discovery Points**:
- 1 DP: Basic clue, safe path
- 3 DP: Hidden cache, shortcut
- 5 DP: Major discovery, rare resource
- 10 DP: Legendary find

### Skill Tree Integration
**Social Branch**:
```
Novice (10 AP):
- Charming: +1 IP on successful Presence rolls
- Analytical: Use Intellect for social reads
- Stubborn: Use Resolve for negotiations

Journeyman (25 AP):
- Network: Bank up to 10 IP between scenes
- Read the Room: See NPC motivations
- Silver Tongue: Reroll one social die/scene

Master (50 AP):
- Puppet Master: Spend IP to create obligations
- Mind Games: Counter-influence immunity
- Social Architect: IP costs reduced by 1

Grandmaster (100 AP):
- Memetic Influence: IP affects entire factions
- Cultural Revolution: Reshape society with IP
```

**Exploration Branch**:
```
Novice (10 AP):
- Scout: +1 DP on successful Awareness rolls
- Researcher: Use Intellect for exploration
- Pathfinder: Reroll exploration dice 1/scene

Journeyman (25 AP):
- Cartographer: Bank up to 10 DP
- Danger Sense: Detect threats before rolls
- Lucky Find: Minimum 2 DP on success

Master (50 AP):
- Explorer's Intuition: DP costs reduced by 1
- Archaeological Genius: Double DP from ruins
- Quantum Scout: See probability paths

Grandmaster (100 AP):
- Dimensional Explorer: Find paths between realities
- Akashic Record: Access universal knowledge with DP
```

## Option 2: Narrative Stakes System

### Core Mechanic
Before rolling, declare stakes:
- **Safe**: Normal TN, normal result
- **Risky**: -2 TN, gain narrative control on success
- **Desperate**: -4 TN, major narrative control but consequences on failure

### Social Implementation
**Safe Social**: "I convince the guard to let me pass"
**Risky Social**: "I convince the guard to let me pass AND tell me the password"
**Desperate Social**: "I convince the guard to let me pass, tell me the password, AND join our cause"

Failed Risky/Desperate = Complications escalate

### Exploration Implementation  
**Safe Exploration**: "I find a path through the ruins"
**Risky Exploration**: "I find a SECRET path that avoids guards"
**Desperate Exploration**: "I find a secret path that leads directly to the treasure"

### Skill Tree Support
Mastery reduces penalties:
- Apprentice: Risky becomes -1 instead of -2
- Master: Desperate becomes -2 instead of -4
- Grandmaster: Can declare "Legendary" stakes at -6

## Option 3: Approach-Based System

### Core Mechanic
Choose approach, use different PRIMAC attribute:

**Social Approaches**:
- **Persuade** (Presence): Direct influence
- **Deceive** (Intellect): Misdirection
- **Intimidate** (Might/Presence): Fear
- **Empathize** (Awareness): Understanding
- **Endure** (Resolve): Outlast opposition

**Exploration Approaches**:
- **Scout** (Awareness): Find the obvious
- **Analyze** (Intellect): Understand patterns
- **Push Through** (Might): Brute force
- **Finesse** (Coordination): Delicate navigation
- **Persist** (Resolve): Methodical search

### Mechanical Benefit
Each NPC/Location has vulnerabilities:
- Corrupt Official: Vulnerable to Deceive (+2), Resistant to Intimidate (-2)
- Ancient Ruins: Vulnerable to Analyze (+2), Resistant to Push Through (-2)

### Skill Tree Enhancement
Specialization unlocks "Signature Approaches":
- Can use your best attribute for specific approaches
- Ignore resistance penalties
- Convert failures to partial successes

## Option 4: Clock System (Simplified)

### Core Mechanic
Major social/exploration challenges have "Clocks" (4, 6, or 8 segments):
- Each success fills 1 segment
- Critical fills 2 segments
- Complete clock = objective achieved

### Implementation
**Social Example**: "Convince the Crime Lord" (6-clock)
- Each roll represents different argument/approach
- Can use different attributes/skills each roll
- Failure might add segments or create complication clock

**Exploration Example**: "Navigate the Nebula" (8-clock)
- Each roll represents navigation challenge
- Different PCs can contribute
- Environmental hazards might clear segments

### Skill Tree Benefits
- Reduce clock size
- Fill extra segments
- Ignore failed segments
- Create beneficial clocks

## Recommendation Analysis

### For Cosmos Engine, I recommend **Option 1: Influence & Discovery Points**

**Why**:
1. **Maintains 2d10 core**: No new mechanics, just success counting
2. **Scales naturally**: Works personal to capital (faction IP, stellar DP)
3. **Specialization friendly**: Trees enhance point generation/spending
4. **Player agency**: Points let players shape narrative
5. **Simple tracking**: Just two numbers (IP/DP)
6. **Cross-system integration**: Points could affect combat, tech, etc.

**Implementation would need**:
- IP/DP costs table
- Example social/exploration scenarios
- How points refresh (per session? per adventure?)
- Faction/organization influence rules
- Exploration danger/reward tables

Would you like me to develop Option 1 further, or would you prefer to explore a different approach?
