# Enhanced Tag System Design - Learning from M&M 2e

## Mutants & Masterminds 2e Descriptor Lessons

### What M&M Did Right
1. **Descriptors as Story Hooks**: Tags weren't just mechanical; they informed narrative
2. **GM Preparation**: Documented tags let GMs plan scenarios
3. **Player Creativity**: Same mechanical effect, different descriptors = unique characters
4. **Complication Fuel**: Descriptors created vulnerabilities and opportunities

## Enhancing Cosmos Engine Tags

### 1. Tag Documentation Requirements

Each character should document not just their tags, but **how they manifest**:

```
CHARACTER: Maya Chen
SPECIALIZATION: Sniper [Precise] [Patient]

TAG MANIFESTATION:
[Precise]: "Neural implant calculates wind resistance and target movement"
[Patient]: "Meditation techniques from monastery training"

GM HOOKS:
- EMP could disrupt [Precise] calculations
- Emotional turmoil affects [Patient] meditation
- Monastery connections provide social opportunities
```

### 2. Expanded Tag Categories

**Source Tags** (HOW you gained the ability):
- [Trained]: Traditional learning
- [Enhanced]: Technological augmentation
- [Innate]: Natural talent
- [Experimental]: Untested methods

**Limitation Tags** (WHEN it doesn't work):
- [Tech-Dependent]: Requires functioning technology
- [Emotional]: Affected by mental state
- [Environmental]: Needs specific conditions
- [Resource]: Consumes something

                    MAYA'S TAG MANIFESTATIONS                   
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[PRECISE] - "Targeting Algorithm"
Source: Neural implant from military service
Visual: HUD overlay appears in vision
Weakness: EMP, hacking, power drain
RP Notes: Sometimes sees targeting data in social situations

[PATIENT] - "Mountain Stillness"  
Source: Three years training with moon colony monks
Visual: Breathing slows, muscles relax completely
Weakness: Strong emotions, time pressure
RP Notes: Quotes monastery teachings, values calm

[DIGITAL] - "Ghost Protocol"
Source: Experimental AI symbiote
Visual: Fingers glow with haptic interfaces
Weakness: Requires network access, AI has own agenda
RP Notes: Argues with AI, treats it as friend

DISCOVERED SYNERGIES:
[Precise] + [Patient] = "Perfect Moment"
- Time seems to slow as implant and training merge
- Once per scene, declare perfect shot
- Described as: "The world becomes mathematics"
```

### 4. GM Scenario Integration

**Pre-Session Planning**:
```
Players with [Digital]: 
- Include hackable systems
- Add AI NPCs to interact with
- Create network dead zones as obstacles

Players with [Brutal]:
- Include enemies that flee
- Add breakable environment
- Create social consequences for violence

Players with [Enhanced]:
- Include enhancement detection/suppression
- Add other enhanced individuals
- Create enhancement side effects
```

### 5. Mechanical Benefits of Documentation

**Invoking for Advantage**:
- Well-documented tag manifestations can grant situational bonuses
- "My [Precise] comes from sniper training, so I should get bonus vs. military targets"

**Accepting Complications**:
- When tag limitations create problems, gain AP or rerolls
- "EMP shuts down my [Digital] tag, but I get an AP for the complication"

**Creating Spotlight Moments**:
- GM can build scenes around specific tag manifestations
- "The ancient ruins respond to Chen's [Patient] monastery training"

### 6. Tag Evolution Through Play

**Level 1-5**: Define basic manifestation
**Level 6-10**: Add nuance and complications
**Level 11-15**: Evolve or transcend limitations
**Level 16-20**: Redefine what the tag means

Example Evolution:
```
Level 1: [Digital] = "Good with computers"
Level 6: [Digital] = "Neural interface installed"
Level 11: [Digital] = "Consciousness partially uploaded"
Level 16: [Digital] = "Exist simultaneously in meat and net"
```

### 7. Social Contract Benefits

**For Players**:
- Creative control over HOW abilities work
- Built-in character development hooks
- Mechanical benefits for good documentation

**For GMs**:
- Pre-documented story hooks
- Player-created scenario elements
- Clear vulnerability/opportunity matrix

**For Groups**:
- Shared understanding of abilities
- Reduced arguments about "how it works"
- Collaborative worldbuilding through tags

## Implementation Guide

### Character Creation Addition
After selecting specializations:
1. List all tags gained
2. Describe manifestation for each
3. Note one strength and one weakness
4. Create connecting narrative

### Session Zero Activity
Players share tag manifestations:
- Group brainstorms crossovers
- GM notes scenario hooks
- Establish tag interaction precedents

### Ongoing Play
- Award inspiration for creative tag use
- Grant AP bonuses for accepting tag complications
- Evolve manifestations through story

## Example: Same Build, Different Characters

**Build**: Combat (Sniper) + Tech (Hacker)
**Tags**: [Precise] [Patient] [Digital]

**Character A - "Ghost Operative"**:
- [Precise]: Cybernetic eye with targeting software
- [Patient]: Special forces training
- [Digital]: Military-grade intrusion suite

**Character B - "Zen Hacker"**:
- [Precise]: Meditation-enhanced focus
- [Patient]: Buddhist philosophy
- [Digital]: Spiritual connection to data flows

**Character C - "Evolved Hunter"**:
- [Precise]: Predator genetics
- [Patient]: Pack hunting instincts
- [Digital]: Symbiotic techno-organism

Same mechanical build, completely different story potential!

## Conclusion

By adding M&M-style documentation to our tag system:
- **Mechanical depth** remains unchanged
- **Narrative depth** increases exponentially
- **GM prep** becomes easier
- **Player creativity** is rewarded
- **Table cohesion** improves

The tags become not just mechanical markers but story drivers, character definers, and scenario seeds—all without adding rules complexity.
