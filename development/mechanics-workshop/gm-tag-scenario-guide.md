# GM Guide: Using Player Tags for Scenario Design

## Philosophy
Player tags aren't just mechanical bonusesâ€”they're story invitations. When players document their tag manifestations, they're telling you what kinds of scenes they want.

## Pre-Session Planning Checklist

### 1. Review Party Tags
List all tags across the party and note:
- **Frequency**: Which tags appear multiple times?
- **Gaps**: What tags are missing?
- **Synergies**: Which players have complementary tags?

### 2. Create Tag Opportunities

For each session, ensure:
- Every player can use their primary tag at least twice
- One scene highlights an unusual tag combination
- One complication arises from tag weaknesses

### 3. Design Tag-Specific Challenges

#### For Action Tags
**[Precise]**: 
- Surgical strikes needed
- Delicate operations
- "Only one shot" scenarios

**[Brutal]**:
- Enemies that need intimidating
- Obstacles requiring raw force
- Social consequences for violence

**[Subtle]**:
- Stealth missions
- Social infiltration
- Hidden objective scenarios

**[Reckless]**:
- Time pressure situations
- "Style points" matter scenarios
- Impress or terrify audiences

#### For Style Tags
**[Tactical]**:
- Complex multi-part operations
- Resource management challenges
- Command NPC allies

**[Creative]**:
- Unconventional problems
- Limited resources
- "Think outside box" puzzles

**[Technical]**:
- High-tech challenges
- Interface with AI/systems
- Optimization problems

**[Intuitive]**:
- Read hidden motivations
- Navigate without data
- Trust instinct moments

#### For Domain Tags
**[Digital]**:
- Hackable systems
- AI personalities
- Data fortresses
- Network dead zones

**[Social]**:
- Negotiations
- Infiltration parties
- Reputation matters
- Cultural navigation

**[Mechanical]**:
- Vehicle challenges
- Repair under fire
- Jury-rig solutions
- Tech era conflicts

## Complication Banking

### The AP Economy
When a player's tag weakness creates problems:
- Minor complication: 1 bonus AP
- Major complication: 2 bonus AP  
- Scene-defining complication: 3 bonus AP

### Example Complications

**[Digital] in a Primitive Era setting**:
"Your neural implant finds no networks here. -2 to all [Digital] actions."
Player accepts: Gain 1 AP

**[Enhanced] during EMP storm**:
"Your augmentations shut down completely for this scene."
Player accepts: Gain 3 AP

**[Patient] under time pressure**:
"You need 10 minutes to use [Patient], but the bomb has 30 seconds."
Player accepts: Gain 2 AP

## Tag Spotlight Techniques

### 1. The Tag Gate
Only characters with specific tags can attempt something:
- "Reading this alien script requires [Technical] or [Intuitive]"
- "The crime lord only respects [Brutal] or [Social]"

### 2. The Tag Bonus
Relevant tags provide advantage:
- "If you have [Environmental], you spot the ambush early"
- "Characters with [Leadership] can command the militia"

### 3. The Tag Combination
Specific combinations unlock options:
- "[Digital] + [Social] can manipulate the AI's personality"
- "[Precise] + [Patient] can perform the nano-surgery"

## Campaign Integration

### Session Zero Activity
**Tag Manifestation Workshop** (30 minutes):
1. Each player describes their tags
2. Group brainstorms one synergy
3. GM notes scenario hooks
4. Establish tag precedents

### Recurring Tag Elements

**Tag NPCs**: Create NPCs that share player tags
- Rival with same tags but different manifestation
- Mentor who mastered the tag
- Student seeking to learn the tag

**Tag Locations**: Build areas that reward/punish tags
- [Digital] paradise: Full-network arcology
- [Brutal] arena: Might makes right
- [Subtle] maze: Stealth required

**Tag McGuffins**: Items that interact with tags
- Ancient device only [Intuitive] can operate
- Weapon that amplifies [Brutal]
- Stealth field generator for [Subtle]

## Final Advice

Remember: Tags are players telling you what they find fun. When they write "[Digital] - Neo-style hacker who sees code everywhere," they're asking for Matrix-like scenarios. Give them what they want, challenge what they rely on, and celebrate their creativity.
