# Social/Exploration Drift Analysis - IP/DP System

## Executive Summary

**Drift Severity**: 🔴 HIGH (50% tracking increase)
**Recommendation**: REJECT IP/DP system
**Alternative**: Design within existing framework

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Tracking Elements
1. **Advancement Points (AP)** - Character progression currency
2. **Strain Capacity** - Technology exhaustion (not points)
3. **Hit Points** - Health tracking
4. **Equipment Condition** - Binary states

Total: 4 tracked elements

### Design Principles at Risk
- ❌ "Binary choices over tracking" (violated by point accumulation)
- ❌ "Meaningful choices over complex tracking" (violated by dual currencies)
- ❌ "2/10 complexity target" (would push to 5-6/10)

## Drift Calculation

### With IP/DP Addition
- Current: 4 tracked elements
- Proposed: 6 tracked elements (adding IP + DP)
- **Increase: 50% more tracking**

### Complexity Budget Impact
```
Current Social/Exploration: 0/10 (doesn't exist)
Target: 2/10
IP/DP System: ~5/10 (exceeds by 150%)
```

## Why IP/DP Conflicts with Cosmos Engine

### 1. Multiple Currency Confusion
- AP for advancement
- IP for social outcomes  
- DP for exploration rewards
- Players must balance three economies

### 2. Tracking Overhead
Your own design document states:
> "Complex tracking creates exactly what we're trying to avoid"

### 3. Scale Inconsistency
- AP scales with character level
- IP/DP would need separate scaling
- Creates parallel progression systems

## Alternative Approaches (Zero Drift)

### Option A: Binary Influence States
```
Influence Levels (per faction/NPC):
□ Unknown
□ Known  
□ Trusted
□ Allied

Achieved through roleplay + successful rolls
No points to track
```

### Option B: Leverage Existing Mechanics
```
Social Challenges:
- Standard 2d10 + PRIMAC + Skill vs TN
- Success = narrative outcome
- Specialization provides rerolls/advantages
- No new currencies
```

### Option C: Discovery as Rewards
```
Exploration Success:
- Gain equipment (uses existing system)
- Unlock specializations (uses AP)
- Find plot elements (narrative)
- No points needed
```

### Option D: Social/Exploration Talents
```
Buy with existing AP:
- "Connected" (10 AP): Known by useful people
- "Explorer" (10 AP): Reroll exploration dice
- "Influential" (25 AP): Social rolls affect groups
- Uses existing framework
```

## Recommended Solution

### Binary Social Standing + Narrative Exploration

**Social System**:
1. Each major faction/NPC has 4 relationship states
2. Actions + successful rolls advance relationships
3. Higher relationships unlock options
4. No points to track

**Exploration System**:
1. Success finds clues/paths/items
2. Specialization grants advantages
3. Technology Era affects what's findable
4. Results are equipment/knowledge/access

**Complexity**: 2/10 ✅
**Drift**: 0% ✅
**Fits Design**: Perfect ✅

## Conclusion

The IP/DP system would create unacceptable drift. Instead, use your existing elegant 2d10 system with binary states and narrative outcomes. This maintains your "complexity budget" and design philosophy while providing rich social/exploration gameplay.

Remember your own guidance:
> "Drift isn't always bad, but it should always be intentional."

In this case, the drift would undermine core design principles for minimal benefit.
