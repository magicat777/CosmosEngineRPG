## Quick Start

### For Game Designers
1. Review the system summary in `docs/core-rules/system_summary.md`
2. Check current design status in `docs/design-notes/`
3. Use templates in `resources/templates/` for new content
4. Log playtesting results in `playtesting/session-logs/`

### For Developers
1. Tool development goes in `tools/[tool-name]/`
2. Each tool should have its own README
3. Share common utilities in `tools/shared/`
4. Test with sample data from `resources/`

### For Playtesters
1. Character sheets and templates in `resources/templates/`
2. Quick reference sheets in `resources/reference-sheets/`
3. Submit feedback using templates in `playtesting/feedback/`

## Current Status

### Completed Systems âœ…
- Core Resolution Mechanic (2d10 + modifiers)
- Scale System (Personal â†’ Capital)
- Combat System (5-6/10 complexity)
- Character Creation Framework
- Technology Era Integration

### In Development ðŸ”§
- Attribute System definitions
- Social/Exploration mechanics
- Equipment catalogs
- Digital tools

### Planned ðŸ“‹
- Campaign framework
- Setting details
- Quick-start materials
- Online play support

## Contributing

1. Create feature branches for new systems
2. Document all mechanics thoroughly
3. Include examples in all rule sections
4. Playtest before merging to main
5. Update version history

## Version Control

This project uses Git for version control. Key branches:
- `main` - Stable, playtest-ready rules
- `development` - Active development
- `feature/*` - Individual features/systems
- `playtest/*` - Playtest-specific versions
