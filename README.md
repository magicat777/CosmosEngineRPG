## Overview

**Cosmos Engine RPG** is a comprehensive science fiction roleplaying game system featuring mathematically balanced mechanics that maintain consistent challenge from levels 1-20. Built on a unified 2d10 resolution system, it supports campaigns ranging from gritty cyberpunk street adventures to epic space opera spanning galactic civilizations.

- **Unified Mechanics**: Single resolution system (2d10 + Attribute + Skill) for all actions
- **Scalable Complexity**: Simple core rules with optional advanced systems
- **Technology Progression**: Four distinct eras from Primitive to Stellar
- **Comprehensive Support**: Complete GM tools, adventures, and player resources

## Features

### ðŸŽ² Balanced Game Mechanics
