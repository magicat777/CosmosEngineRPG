# Encounter Design Guide - Balanced System

## Overview

This guide provides Game Masters with tools and guidelines for creating balanced, engaging encounters using the Cosmos Engine balanced combat system. All recommendations are based on the mathematical foundation established in Phases 1-2 of the system update.

**Core Principles**:
- 85% hit rate target for same-level combat
- Meaningful tactical choices at all levels
- Level gap mechanics for mixed encounters
- Equipment provides options, not dominance
- Skill advancement remains primary progression

## Level Gap Mechanics

### Minion Rules (5-9 Level Difference)
**When to Use**: Lower-level opponents against higher-level party
**Mechanics**:
- Take double damage from all sources
- Morale penalties when allies are defeated
- Still use normal attack/defense calculations
- Good for showing character growth

**Example**: Level 10 party vs Level 5 security guards
- Guards have normal stats but take double damage
- Creates "mowing through minions" feel
- Maintains some threat from lucky hits

### Mook Rules (10+ Level Difference)
**When to Use**: Vastly outleveled opponents
**Mechanics**:
- Defeated by any successful hit (regardless of damage)
- Automatically hit by attacks against them
- Provide narrative rather than mechanical challenge
- Good for demonstrating legendary status

**Example**: Level 20 characters vs Level 5 pirates
- Any hit defeats a pirate instantly
- Pirates cannot meaningfully threaten heroes
- Focus on objectives, not combat survival

### Elite Scaling (Boss Opponents)
**When to Use**: Challenging single opponents
**Mechanics**:
- +2 Defense per 5 levels above party
- Multiple actions per round
- Immunity to minion/mook rules
- Special abilities and legendary actions

**Example**: Level 10 party vs Level 15 Sith Lord
- Sith Lord has +2 Defense bonus
- Takes 2 actions per round
- Has legendary saves and special powers
- Creates memorable boss fight

## Encounter Types and Design

### Combat Encounters

#### Straightforward Fight
**Purpose**: Test combat abilities directly
**Design**:
- Equal-level opponents with clear motivations
- Tactical terrain features (cover, elevation)
- Win condition: defeat all enemies
- Duration: 6-12 rounds ideal

**Example**: Rival mercenary team
- 4 Level 8 opponents vs 4 Level 8 heroes
- Urban environment with cover and elevation
- Each opponent has distinct role and equipment

#### Asymmetric Challenge
**Purpose**: Force creative problem-solving
**Design**:
- Opponents with unique advantages/vulnerabilities  
- Environmental factors favor one side
- Multiple win conditions available
- Encourages non-combat solutions

**Example**: Defending against superior force
- 12 Level 6 attackers vs 4 Level 8 heroes
- Heroes have fortified position and preparation time
- Win conditions: survive 10 rounds, destroy objective, or escape

#### Chase Scene
**Purpose**: Dynamic movement-focused encounter
**Design**:
- Moving battlefield with changing conditions
- Speed and positioning more important than raw damage
- Time pressure with escalating consequences
- Mix of combat and skill challenges

**Example**: Starship pursuit through asteroid field
- Running combat between ships
- Pilot checks to navigate hazards
- Engineering checks to maintain systems
- Gunner attacks when in range

### Social Encounters

#### Negotiation
**Purpose**: Test social skills and character relationships
**Design**:
- Clear stakes and multiple interested parties
- Information asymmetry between sides
- Escalating tension with failure consequences
- Multiple resolution paths

**Balanced System Integration**:
- Social skill bonuses follow same (Skill รท 2) scaling
- Equipment bonuses from reputation, gear, connections
- Level gaps affect respect and influence

#### Investigation
**Purpose**: Reward careful observation and deduction
**Design**:
- Multiple information sources with varying reliability
- Clues available through different skill approaches
- Red herrings and misdirection
- Time pressure optional but effective

**Balanced System Integration**:
- Investigation skill bonuses scale appropriately
- Technology era affects available tools
- Cross-skill synergies reward diverse approaches

### Exploration Encounters

#### Environmental Challenge
**Purpose**: Test resource management and problem-solving
**Design**:
- Hazardous conditions requiring specific solutions
- Multiple approaches with different risk/reward ratios
- Resource depletion creates escalating tension
- Clear failure states and recovery options

**Example**: Crossing unstable dimensional rift
- Requires Technology, Survival, and Psionics checks
- Equipment can provide bonuses but creates dependencies
- Failure has consequences but isn't instant death

#### Discovery Scenario
**Purpose**: Reward curiosity and exploration
**Design**:
- Hidden secrets requiring specific approaches to uncover
- Layered reveals with increasing significance
- Optional content that enriches the experience
- Multiple ways to achieve discovery

## Scaling Encounters Across Levels

### Mathematical Scaling
| Party Level | Opponent Levels | Hit Rate | Challenge Level |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| 5 | 5 (Equal) | 85% | Moderate |
| 5 | 3 (Lower) | 95% | Easy |
| 5 | 7 (Higher) | 65% | Hard |
| 5 | 10+ (Much Higher) | Use Elite rules | Boss Fight |

### Equipment Integration
- **Low Level (1-5)**: Equipment differences create significant advantages
- **Mid Level (6-10)**: Equipment important but skill dominates
- **High Level (11-15)**: Equipment provides specialization options
- **Legendary (16-20)**: Equipment enables unique capabilities

### Technology Era Considerations
- **Primitive Era**: Focus on personal skill and tactical positioning
- **Industrial Era**: Equipment reliability becomes factor
- **Advanced Era**: Technology integration creates new options
- **Stellar Era**: Equipment enables previously impossible actions
