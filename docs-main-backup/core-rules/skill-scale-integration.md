# Skill-Scale Integration System

## Overview

In Cosmos Engine, skill ratings unlock access to progressively larger scales of operation. As characters advance in skill, they gain the ability to operate at scales beyond personal - from vehicles to starships to massive capital-class operations.

## Scale Access by Skill Rating

### Personal Scale (Always Available)
- **Requirement**: Any skill rating (0-5)
- **Scope**: Individual actions, hand-held equipment
- **Examples**: Personal combat, medical treatment, hacking terminals

### Vehicle Scale (Skill 1+)
- **Requirement**: Skill rating 1 or higher
- **Scope**: Ground vehicles, aircraft, small vessels
- **Training**: Basic certification or practical experience
- **Examples**: 
  - Pilot 1: Cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters
  - Combat 1: Vehicle-mounted weapons, tank operations
  - Tech 1: Vehicle diagnostics and repair

### Starship Scale (Skill 3+)
- **Requirement**: Skill rating 3 or higher
- **Scope**: Spacecraft, system-wide operations
- **Training**: Advanced certification or military service
- **Examples**:
  - Pilot 3: Fighters, shuttles, freighters
  - Engineering 3: Starship systems, FTL drives
  - Command 3: Bridge operations, tactical command

### Capital Scale (Skill 5)
- **Requirement**: Skill rating 5 (Legendary)
- **Scope**: Massive vessels, fleet operations, planetary systems
- **Training**: Elite academies or decades of experience
- **Examples**:
  - Pilot 5: Dreadnoughts, city-ships, mobile stations
  - Command 5: Fleet admiral, planetary governance
  - Tech 5: Dyson spheres, planetary shields

## Scale Penalties Without Training

Characters can attempt actions at scales above their skill rating with penalties:

### Untrained Scale Operation
- **One Scale Above**: -3 penalty (desperate circumstances)
- **Two Scales Above**: -6 penalty (nearly impossible)
- **Three Scales Above**: Cannot attempt without GM permission

**Example**: A character with Pilot 2 (Vehicle scale) trying to fly a starship:
- Base roll: 2d10 + Coordination + Pilot 2
- Scale penalty: -3 (one scale above training)
- Total: 2d10 + Coordination + Pilot 2 - 3

## Skill-Specific Scale Progressions

### PILOT Skill
- **0**: Can operate basic personal vehicles with penalty
- **1**: Ground vehicles (cars, bikes, boats)
- **2**: Aircraft (planes, helicopters, hovercrafts)
- **3**: Starships (shuttles, fighters, freighters)
- **4**: Advanced starships (cruisers, specialized craft)
- **5**: Capital ships (dreadnoughts, carriers, stations)

### COMBAT Skill
- **0**: Personal weapons only
- **1**: Vehicle weapons (mounted guns, tank cannons)
- **2**: Advanced vehicle systems (missiles, artillery)
- **3**: Starship weapons (lasers, torpedoes)
- **4**: Capital weapons (mass drivers, nova cannons)
- **5**: Superweapons (planet crackers, singularity weapons)

### TECH Skill
- **0**: Personal devices only
- **1**: Vehicle systems (engines, navigation)
- **2**: Complex vehicles (aircraft avionics)
- **3**: Starship systems (FTL, shields)
- **4**: Capital systems (city-sized reactors)
- **5**: Megastructures (ringworlds, Dyson spheres)

### ENGINEERING Skill
- **0**: Simple repairs and construction
- **1**: Vehicle maintenance and modification
- **2**: Aircraft and complex machinery
- **3**: Starship construction and repair
- **4**: Space station assembly
- **5**: Planetary engineering projects

### COMMAND Skill
- **0**: Personal authority only
- **1**: Squad/team leadership (3-12 people)
- **2**: Company command (50-200 people)
- **3**: Ship command (20-5,000 crew)
- **4**: Task force command (multiple ships)
- **5**: Fleet admiral (entire navies)

### MEDICINE Skill
- **0**: First aid only
- **1**: Emergency vehicle medicine
- **2**: Field hospital operations
- **3**: Starship medical bays
- **4**: Space station hospitals
- **5**: Planetary health systems

## Acquiring Scale Training

### Natural Progression
Characters automatically gain scale access when reaching the required skill rating through normal advancement.

### Accelerated Training
Characters can gain early scale access through:
- **Certification Courses**: 10-50 AP depending on scale
- **Military Service**: Included in background
- **Mentorship**: Learning from higher-skilled character
- **Emergency Situations**: GM may allow temporary access

### Scale Specializations
Some advancement trees provide early scale access:
- **Vehicle Specialist**: Vehicle scale at Pilot 0
- **Navy Background**: Starship scale at Pilot 2
- **Fleet Officer**: Capital scale at Command 4

## Cross-Scale Synergies

### Supporting Actions
Characters can use their skills to support higher-scale operations even without direct access:
- Personal scale medic treating starship crew
- Vehicle mechanic assisting with starship repairs
- Ground commander coordinating with fleet operations

### Scale Translation
Some skills translate differently at each scale:
- **Stealth**: Personal hiding → Vehicle camouflage → Ship cloaking → Fleet deception
- **Social**: Personal persuasion → Crew morale → Diplomatic missions → Species relations
- **Larceny**: Pickpocketing → Vehicle theft → Ship piracy → Corporate espionage

## Design Intent

This system ensures that:
1. **Progression Feels Earned**: Operating larger scales requires genuine expertise
2. **Skills Stay Relevant**: Every skill has applications at multiple scales
3. **Flexibility Exists**: Emergency situations allow dramatic attempts
4. **Specialization Matters**: Dedicated pilots fly better than generalists
5. **Story Opportunities**: Scale limitations create narrative tension

## Quick Reference

| Skill Rating | Scale Access | Description |

| 1 | Vehicle | Cars, boats, small craft |
| 2 | Vehicle+ | Aircraft, complex vehicles |
| 3 | Starship | Spacecraft, system operations |
| 4 | Starship+ | Advanced ships, multi-ship coordination |
| 5 | Capital | Massive vessels, fleet command |
