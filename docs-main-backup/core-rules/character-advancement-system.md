# Character Advancement System

## Overview

The Cosmos Engine character advancement system uses Advancement Points (AP) to track character growth from local heroes to galactic legends. Characters progress through 20 levels across four distinct tiers, with advancement balanced to occur every 2-5 sessions regardless of level. The system encourages specialization over generalization while providing meaningful choices at every stage.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Consistent advancement pace across all 20 levels
- Meaningful choices over power inflation
- Specialization rewarded, generalization possible but costly
- Clear progression milestones tied to campaign significance
- Flexible pacing for different campaign styles

**Core Principles**: Steady progression, Specialization focus, Tier-based scaling, Session-based pacing, Campaign integration
