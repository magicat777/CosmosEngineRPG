# Combat Balance Rules

## Overview

This document provides specific rules for maintaining balance in combat encounters across different character levels and experience gaps. These rules work with the balanced combat system to ensure encounters remain challenging and fun.

## Level Gap Mechanics

### Minion Rules

When characters face opponents significantly below their level:

#### 5-9 Level Difference
**Minion Status**: Lower level opponents become "Minions"
- **Double Damage**: Minions take double damage from all sources
- **Morale Effect**: Seeing minions easily defeated causes Fear checks (TN 13) in other minions
- **Tactical Value**: Still useful for flanking, cover, and support roles

#### 10+ Level Difference  
**Mook Status**: Lower level opponents become "Mooks"
- **One-Hit Defeats**: Any successful hit defeats a mook regardless of damage
- **Automatic Success**: Characters automatically succeed on attacks vs mooks
- **Narrative Function**: Used for dramatic effect, not tactical challenge

### Elite Scaling

To keep powerful opponents challenging:

#### Elite Designation
Bosses and major opponents receive **Elite** status:
- **Scale Immunity**: Immune to minion/mook rules regardless of level gap
- **Defense Bonus**: +2 Defense per 5 levels above party average
- **Action Economy**: May take additional actions per round
- **Damage Threshold**: Must take minimum 25% HP damage per round to be affected

#### Legendary Opponents
The most powerful enemies become **Legendary**:
- **Multiple Actions**: 2-3 actions per round
- **Legendary Resistance**: Automatic success on 3 saves per encounter
- **Lair Actions**: Environmental effects on initiative count 20
- **Mythic Scaling**: Stats continue to improve beyond normal caps

## Encounter Scaling Guidelines

### Building Balanced Encounters

#### Same Level Encounters
**1-on-1 Fights**:
- Hit rates: ~50-60% for both sides
- Combat duration: 6-10 rounds
- Outcome: Comes down to tactics and luck

**Multiple Opponents**:
- 2-on-1: Significant advantage (70% win rate)
- 3-on-1: Overwhelming advantage (90% win rate)
- Use terrain and tactics to balance

#### Mixed Level Encounters

**Party with Level Spread**:
- Design encounters for average party level
- Give lower level characters support roles
- Ensure everyone has meaningful contributions

**Opponents of Varying Levels**:
- Mix of minions, regulars, and elites
- Minions provide numbers
- Regulars offer standard challenge
- Elites create focus points

### Challenge Rating System

#### Encounter Difficulty by Numbers

**Easy Encounter** (75% party victory chance):
- Equal level: 1 opponent per 2 party members
- -2 levels: 1 opponent per party member
- -5 levels: 2 opponents per party member

**Moderate Encounter** (60% party victory chance):
- Equal level: 1 opponent per party member
- +2 levels: 1 opponent per 2 party members
- +5 levels: 1 opponent per 4 party members

**Hard Encounter** (40% party victory chance):
- +2 levels: 1 opponent per party member
- +5 levels: 1 opponent per 2 party members
- +10 levels: 1 Elite opponent vs entire party

**Epic Encounter** (25% party victory chance):
- +5 levels: 2 opponents per party member
- +10 levels: 1 Elite + minions
- +15 levels: 1 Legendary opponent

## Damage Scaling Balance

### Keeping Combat Paced

#### Early Levels (1-5)
**Combat Duration Target**: 8-12 rounds
- Lower damage ensures tactical decisions matter
- Multiple wound states create drama
- Equipment and positioning crucial

#### Mid Levels (6-10)
**Combat Duration Target**: 6-10 rounds
- Increased damage from skill scaling
- More decisive actions
- Specializations become important

#### High Levels (11-15)
**Combat Duration Target**: 4-8 rounds
- High skill bonuses create reliable hits
- Damage scaling keeps pace with HP growth
- Elite opponents needed for challenge

#### Epic Levels (16-20)
**Combat Duration Target**: 3-6 rounds
- Legendary abilities active
- Massive damage potential
- Environmental factors critical

### HP vs Damage Progression

#### Damage Growth Curve
| Level | Average Damage | Average HP | Rounds to Defeat |
|-------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| 1     | 5.5            | 80         | 14               |
| 5     | 7.5            | 100        | 13               |
| 10    | 11             | 120        | 11               |
| 15    | 14             | 140        | 10               |
| 20    | 15.5           | 160        | 10               |

**Design Note**: Damage scales faster than HP at higher levels to prevent combat from becoming tedious.

## Cross-Scale Encounters

### Personal vs Vehicle Scale

#### Vehicle Advantages
- **Armor**: Personal weapons reduced effectiveness
- **Firepower**: Vehicle weapons devastating to individuals
- **Mobility**: Faster movement, tactical positioning

#### Personal Advantages
- **Agility**: Harder to target with vehicle weapons
- **Access**: Can board, sabotage, or disable vehicles
- **Numbers**: Multiple personnel can swarm vehicles

#### Balance Mechanics
- Personal scale weapons need armor-piercing to affect vehicles
- Vehicle weapons have minimum ranges vs personnel
- Environmental factors (terrain, buildings) level playing field

### Starship vs Personal Scale

#### Starship Overwhelming Advantages
- **Scale Difference**: 2+ scales larger
- **Firepower**: Single shot devastating
- **Defenses**: Personal weapons ineffective

#### Personal Infiltration Options
- **Boarding Actions**: Get inside defensive perimeter
- **Sabotage**: Target critical systems
- **Information Warfare**: Hack ship systems

#### Balance Through Scenario
- Ships can't fire on personnel inside
- Environmental restrictions (civilian areas, fragile targets)
- Mission objectives beyond pure combat

---

## Status Effect Scaling

### Low Level Status Effects
**Simple Conditions**:
- Binary on/off states
- Single action to recover
- Obvious visual indicators

**Examples**:
- Stunned (lose next action)
- Prone (movement penalty)
- Blinded (attack penalty)

### High Level Status Effects
**Complex Conditions**:
- Multiple severity levels
- Require specific countermeasures
- Interact with other effects

**Examples**:
- Cascade System Failure (progressive worsening)
- Temporal Displacement (complex time effects)
- Reality Distortion (fundamental rule changes)

### Scaling Resistance
**Level-Based Immunity**:
- High level characters resist low-level effects
- +1 to saves per 5 levels vs lower level sources
- Automatic immunity to effects 10+ levels below

#### Defender Countermeasures
- **Awareness**: High Awareness may negate surprise
- **Emergency Protocols**: Quick reaction procedures
- **Equipment**: Automated defenses, early warning

### Stealth Encounters

#### Stealth Mechanics
**Detection Threshold**: Stealth vs Awareness + Investigation
- **Undetected**: Full surprise benefits
- **Detected**: Normal initiative and combat
- **Partially Detected**: General awareness but not precise location

#### Scaling Stealth Challenge
- Low level: Simple hide and move
- High level: Electronic countermeasures, exotic stealth

### Social Combat Integration

#### Combat in Social Situations
**Reputation Consequences**: Violence affects social standing
**Collateral Damage**: Environmental destruction has social costs

## GM Tools for Balance

### Quick Assessment

#### Is the Encounter Balanced?
1. **Hit Rates**: Are both sides hitting 50-70% of the time?
2. **Damage Rates**: Will combat end in 4-12 rounds?
3. **Tactical Options**: Do both sides have meaningful choices?
4. **Resource Costs**: Are players spending consumables appropriately?

#### Red Flags
- **Auto-hit/Auto-miss**: Check level gaps and modifiers
- **Too Fast/Slow**: Adjust damage or HP on the fly
- **One-sided**: Add tactical options for losing side
- **Boring**: Introduce environmental factors or complications

### Mid-Combat Interventions

#### Subtle Adjustments
- Modify dice rolls by ±1 behind screen
- Add/remove environmental factors
- Adjust enemy tactics and positioning

#### Dramatic Interventions
- Environmental changes (power failure, structural damage)
- Unexpected allies or enemies arrive
- Mission parameters change mid-fight

### Post-Combat Analysis

#### Learning from Encounters
1. **Duration**: Was it the target length?
2. **Challenge**: Did it feel appropriately difficult?
3. **Tactics**: Did positioning and equipment matter?
4. **Fun**: Did everyone have meaningful contributions?

Use analysis to calibrate future encounters.
