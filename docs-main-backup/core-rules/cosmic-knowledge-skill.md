# Cosmic Knowledge Skill

## Overview

Cosmic Knowledge represents understanding of reality's true nature, comprehension of alien sciences, and awareness of humanity's insignificant place in an indifferent universe. Unlike other skills that purely benefit characters, Cosmic Knowledge is a double-edged sword - granting power while eroding sanity.

**Core Concept**: The more you understand the cosmos, the less human you become.

## Skill Mechanics

### Basic Properties

**Skill Name**: Cosmic Knowledge
**Key Attribute**: Intellect
**Starting Value**: 0 (blessed ignorance)
**Maximum Value**: 10 (complete cosmic awareness)
**Cost**: Normal skill advancement points

### Skill Progression

**Advancement Points Required**:
- Level 0→1: 10 AP (first glimpse of truth)
- Level 1→2: 20 AP (deeper understanding)
- Level 2→3: 30 AP (dangerous comprehension)
- Level 3→4: 40 AP (inhuman insight)
- Level 4→5: 50 AP (reality's blueprint)
- Level 5→6: 60 AP (cosmic mathematics)
- Level 6→7: 70 AP (dimensional awareness)
- Level 7→8: 80 AP (temporal omniscience)
- Level 8→9: 90 AP (near-transcendence)
- Level 9→10: 100 AP (apotheosis approaching)

### Sanity Impact

**Maximum Sanity Calculation**:
```
Maximum Sanity = 100 - (Cosmic Knowledge × 10)

Examples:
- Cosmic Knowledge 0: Max Sanity 100 (blissful ignorance)
- Cosmic Knowledge 3: Max Sanity 70 (touched by truth)
- Cosmic Knowledge 5: Max Sanity 50 (half-mad with knowledge)
- Cosmic Knowledge 7: Max Sanity 30 (barely human)
- Cosmic Knowledge 10: Max Sanity 0 (transcendent madness)
```

**Important**: When Cosmic Knowledge increases, current sanity cannot exceed the new maximum. Excess sanity is immediately lost as the mind reels from new understanding.
