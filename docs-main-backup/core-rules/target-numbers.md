# Target Numbers (1-10 Attribute System)

## Overview

With the expansion from 1-5 to 1-10 attributes, all Target Numbers have been adjusted upward by +3 to maintain appropriate challenge levels. This ensures that tasks remain appropriately difficult relative to character capabilities.

## Standard Difficulty Scale

| Difficulty | Old TN (1-5) | New TN (1-10) | Success Chance* | Description |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Trivial** | 6 | 9 | 90% | Almost impossible to fail |
| **Easy** | 8 | 11 | 80% | Routine task under pressure |
| **Moderate** | 11 | 14 | 65% | Standard difficulty |
| **Hard** | 14 | 17 | 45% | Requires expertise |
| **Extreme** | 17 | 20 | 25% | Pushes human limits |
| **Legendary** | 20 | 23 | 10% | Beyond normal possibility |
| **Impossible** | 23 | 26 | <5% | Requires divine intervention |

*Success chances assume average attribute (5) + modest skill (2) = +7 bonus

## Defense Calculations

### Physical Defense
```
10 + Coordination + Armor + Situational Modifiers
```
- Base increased from 8 to 10
- Typical range: 11-20 (starting characters)
- Maximum: ~25 (high-level with best equipment)

### Mental Defense
```
10 + Resolve + (Intellect รท 2, rounded down)
```
- Typical range: 12-18 (starting characters)
- Protects against mental attacks and influence

### Electronic Defense
```
10 + Intellect + System Rating
```
- Typical range: 11-18 (starting characters)
- Defends against hacking and EM attacks

## Opposed Roll Guidelines

When characters act against each other:
1. Both roll 2d10 + Attribute + Skill
2. Higher total wins
3. Ties go to:
   - Defender (if defensive action)
   - Initiator (if offensive action)
   - Higher attribute (if still tied)

### Common Opposed Rolls
- **Grappling**: Might + Combat vs Might/Coordination + Combat
- **Deception**: Presence + Social vs Awareness + Social
- **Stealth**: Coordination + Stealth vs Awareness + Awareness
- **Hacking**: Intellect + Tech vs Electronic Defense

## Environmental Modifiers

### Favorable Conditions (+1 to +3)
- **Minor Advantage** (+1): Good lighting, familiar equipment
- **Significant Advantage** (+2): Superior position, quality tools
- **Major Advantage** (+3): Perfect conditions, divine favor

### Unfavorable Conditions (-1 to -3)
- **Minor Hindrance** (-1): Poor lighting, improvised tools
- **Significant Hindrance** (-2): Darkness, damaged equipment
- **Major Hindrance** (-3): Blinded, using alien technology

## Quick Reference

### Average Character Bonuses by Level
- **Level 1**: +7 to +9 (Attribute 5-6 + Skill 1 + Equipment 1-2)
- **Level 5**: +10 to +12 (Attribute 6-7 + Skill 3 + Equipment 2-3)
- **Level 10**: +13 to +15 (Attribute 7-8 + Skill 4 + Equipment 3-4)
- **Level 15**: +16 to +18 (Attribute 8-9 + Skill 5 + Equipment 4-5)
- **Level 20**: +19 to +21 (Attribute 9-10 + Skill 5 + Equipment 5-6)

### Success Probability Quick Chart
With 2d10 system (average roll = 11):

| Bonus | TN 11 | TN 14 | TN 17 | TN 20 | TN 23 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| +5 | 75% | 50% | 25% | 8% | 1% |
| +7 | 85% | 65% | 40% | 18% | 3% |
| +10 | 95% | 80% | 60% | 35% | 13% |
| +13 | 99% | 90% | 75% | 53% | 28% |
| +16 | 99% | 97% | 87% | 70% | 45% |

## Design Notes

The +3 adjustment maintains the same relative difficulty while accounting for the expanded attribute range. A starting character with attribute 5 in the new system is equivalent to attribute 3 in the old system, making the +3 TN adjustment preserve game balance while providing more granular character progression.
