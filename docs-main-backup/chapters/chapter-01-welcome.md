# Chapter 1: Welcome to Cosmos Engine

## What is Cosmos Engine?

Cosmos Engine is a science fiction tabletop roleplaying game that scales seamlessly from intimate character-driven stories to galaxy-spanning conflicts. Using a unified 2d10 resolution system, players can explore any type of science fiction narrative - from the crew of a small trading vessel navigating political intrigue to massive fleets clashing in wars that determine the fate of civilizations.

### Core Features

**Unified Mechanics**: Every action, from picking a lock to commanding a fleet, uses the same core 2d10 + Attribute + Skill system.

**Scalable Gameplay**: Four integrated scales of play:
- **Personal Scale**: Individual characters and their actions
- **Vehicle Scale**: Ground and atmospheric vehicles
- **Starship Scale**: Spacecraft and their crews
- **Mass Combat Scale**: Armies, fleets, and massive conflicts

**Modular Design**: Use only the scales you need. Run a personal-scale game like Firefly, add starships for The Expanse-style adventures, or include everything for epic Star Wars-scale campaigns.

**Player Agency**: Characters remain meaningful at every scale. A single hero can influence the outcome of massive battles through leadership, special missions, or crucial actions.

## What is Roleplaying?

In a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG), you and your friends collaborate to tell an interactive story. One player takes the role of Game Master (GM), describing the universe and playing all the supporting characters. The other players each control a single protagonist - their player character (PC) - making decisions and rolling dice to determine outcomes.

Unlike a book or movie, no one knows exactly how the story will unfold. The GM presents situations, players decide how their characters respond, and dice determine success or failure. The result is a unique narrative that emerges from your collective creativity.

## The Science Fiction Sandbox

Cosmos Engine provides tools to explore any science fiction setting you can imagine:

**Hard Science Fiction**: Focus on realistic technology, physics constraints, and the challenges of space exploration. Every decision has weight, resources are limited, and the universe follows consistent rules.

**Space Opera**: Epic adventures with faster-than-light travel, alien civilizations, and galaxy-spanning conflicts. Heroes shape the fate of entire star systems through courage and determination.

**Cyberpunk**: Dive into dystopian futures where technology and humanity clash. Navigate corporate intrigue, hack reality itself, and decide what it means to be human in a digital age.

**Military SF**: Lead squads through desperate battles, command fleets in massive engagements, or wage guerrilla warfare against overwhelming odds. Strategy and tactics determine survival.

**Cosmic Horror**: Confront incomprehensible alien entities and existential threats. Knowledge comes at the cost of sanity, and victory often means merely surviving with your humanity intact.

**Post-Apocalyptic**: Explore the ruins of fallen civilizations, scavenge ancient technology, and rebuild in the shadow of a cosmic catastrophe. Every discovery could be salvation or doom.

## Using This Book

This book is organized to teach you Cosmos Engine step by step:

**Part I (Chapters 1-2)** introduces the game and its core mechanics. Start here to understand how everything works.

**Part II (Chapters 3-4)** covers character creation and advancement. Players should read these chapters to build their heroes.

**Part III (Chapters 5-7)** details personal-scale play: actions, combat, skills, and equipment. Everyone should be familiar with these rules.

**Part IV (Chapters 8-10)** explores advanced systems: starships, electronic warfare, and faster-than-light travel. Use these when your campaign expands beyond personal adventures.

**Part V (Chapters 11-13)** provides Game Master tools and guidance. GMs should read these chapters to run engaging campaigns.

**Part VI (Chapters 14-16)** presents optional systems like mass combat and cosmic horror. Add these when they enhance your story.

### What You Need to Play

To play Cosmos Engine, you'll need:
- **Dice**: Two ten-sided dice (2d10) per player, plus a full polyhedral set (d4, d6, d8, d12, d20) for damage and special rolls
- **Character Sheets**: One per player (available at [website])

## Example of Play

*Sarah (GM), Alex (playing Captain Chen), Brook (playing Dr. Vasquez), and Casey (playing Zara the pilot) are exploring a derelict space station.*

**Sarah (GM)**: The airlock hisses open, revealing a corridor lit only by emergency strips along the floor. The walls are covered in what looks like frost, but it glimmers with an oily sheen. What do you do?

**Alex (Captain Chen)**: I motion for the team to hold position while I scan with my multi-spectrum analyzer. Any life signs or energy readings?

**Sarah**: Roll your Awareness plus Tech.

**Alex**: *rolls 2d10* I got a 7 and a 4, plus my Awareness of 6 and Tech skill of 3... that's 20 total.

**Sarah**: Your scanner goes haywire for a moment, displaying impossible readings - energy signatures that exist in eleven dimensions. Then it stabilizes. You detect faint power in the station's core and... something moving three sections ahead. The signature doesn't match anything in your database.

**Brook (Dr. Vasquez)**: "Captain, that frost... may I?" I want to carefully collect a sample without touching it directly.

**Casey (Zara)**: While the doc does that, I'm checking our six and looking for alternate routes. This corridor feels like a killbox.

**Sarah**: Good instincts. Zara, roll Awareness plus Survival to assess tactical threats.

**Casey**: *rolls* 15 total.

**Sarah**: You notice the corridor has no cover and the emergency lighting creates regular blind spots. Worse, you spot scratch marks on the ceiling - something with claws has been moving through here, and recently. Dr. Vasquez, roll Intellect plus Science for your sample collection.

**Brook**: *rolls* That's... a critical failure. Two 1s.

**Sarah**: As you extend your sampling tool, the "frost" suddenly moves, flowing up the tool toward your hand like living mercury. Roll a Resolve save, TN 14, or drop the tool reflexively.

**Brook**: *rolls* 16! I maintain my grip.

**Sarah**: You hold steady as the substance reaches your gloved hand and stops, pulsing with a faint bioluminescent glow. Through your suit's haptic feedback, you feel it's surprisingly warm. Your suit's quarantine alarm begins chirping.

**Alex**: "Everyone back to the ship. Now. We're not equipped for this."

**Sarah**: As you start to retreat, the movement on your scanner suddenly shifts direction - heading toward you at increasing speed. The station's lights flicker and die. In the darkness, you hear a sound like breaking glass mixed with whale song. Roll for initiative...

*This example demonstrates core mechanics (2d10 + Attribute + Skill), multiple skill applications, critical failures creating complications, and how player choices drive the narrative forward.*

## Your First Session

When you sit down for your first game of Cosmos Engine:

1. **Discuss the Campaign**: What kind of science fiction story excites everyone? Establish boundaries and expectations using the safety tools in Chapter 11.

2. **Create Characters**: Work through Chapter 3 together. Build connections between characters - why are they working together?

3. **Start Small**: Begin with personal-scale adventures. You can always add starships and larger conflicts later.

4. **Learn Together**: Don't worry about getting every rule right. The core mechanic (2d10 + Attribute + Skill vs Target Number) will carry you through most situations.

5. **Embrace the Unknown**: Science fiction thrives on discovery. Let your curiosity drive the story forward.

## Welcome to the Cosmos

Whether you're smuggling cargo past imperial blockades, uncovering conspiracies that span star systems, fighting to preserve humanity against cosmic horrors, or exploring the mysteries of the universe, Cosmos Engine provides the tools to tell your story.

The cosmos awaits. What will you discover among the stars?
