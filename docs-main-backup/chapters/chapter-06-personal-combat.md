# Chapter 6: Personal Combat

Combat in Cosmos Engine is fast, deadly, and tactical. This chapter covers all aspects of personal-scale combat: initiative, attacks, defense, damage, healing, and tactical options. The balanced combat system ensures that skill matters as much as equipment, maintaining consistent challenge across all levels.

## Combat Overview

### Combat Sequence

1. **Determine Awareness**: Check for surprise
2. **Roll Initiative**: Determine action order
3. **Declare Actions**: In initiative order
4. **Resolve Actions**: Apply results
5. **End of Round**: Reset for next round

Each combat round represents 6 seconds of intense action.

### Initiative

- Can interrupt with Awareness check TN 17

**Initiative Modifiers**:

### Surprise

When combat begins unexpectedly:

   - Critical Success: Act first regardless of initiative
   - Critical Failure: Frozen in shock (no actions for 2 rounds)

## Making Attacks (Balanced System)

### Attack Formula

**Basic Attack**: 2d10 + Attribute + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Equipment + Modifiers

The balanced system divides Combat skill by 2, preventing excessive bonuses at high levels while maintaining skill relevance.

### Melee Combat

**Standard Melee Attack**: 2d10 + Might + (Combat ÷ 2) + Weapon

**Finesse Weapons**: May use Coordination instead of Might
- Knives, rapiers, energy blades
- Usually lower damage but more accurate

**Reach**:
- Unarmed: 1 meter
- Standard weapons: 1-2 meters  
- Pole weapons: 3 meters
- Whips/chains: 4 meters

**Melee Damage**: Weapon damage + Equipment bonus
- Might bonus only with two-handed weapons
- Combat skill training improves accuracy, not damage

### Ranged Combat

**Standard Ranged Attack**: 2d10 + Coordination + (Combat ÷ 2) + Weapon

**Range Categories**:

## Defense (Balanced System)

### Defense Calculation

**Physical Defense**: 10 + Coordination + (Combat Skill ÷ 2) + Cover + Armor

The balanced system ensures combat training improves both offense and defense equally.

**Defense Components**:
- **Base**: Always 10
- **Coordination**: Natural agility and reflexes
- **Combat Training**: (Combat ÷ 2) from experience

- **Shields**: +1 to +2 when actively used

### Situational Defenses

**Full Defense** (Standard action): +4 Defense until next turn
