# Chapter 5: Actions and Skills

Skills represent your character's training, experience, and expertise in various fields. Combined with attributes, they determine your effectiveness at tasks throughout the cosmos. This chapter details how skills work, what each skill covers, and how to use them in play.

## Skill Basics

### Using Skills

**Basic Skill Check**: 2d10 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers vs Target Number

When attempting a task with uncertain outcome:
1. GM determines which skill applies
2. Player chooses appropriate attribute pairing
3. GM sets Target Number based on difficulty
4. Roll dice and compare to TN

### Skill Ratings

Skills range from 0 (untrained) to 10 (legendary mastery):

| Rating | Level | Description | Availability |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | Untrained | No formal training, rely on attribute alone | Always |
| 1-2 | Novice | Basic training or casual experience | Character creation |
| 3-4 | Professional | Competent practitioner, can make a living | Character creation |
| 5 | Expert | Highly skilled, starting maximum | Character creation limit |
| 6-7 | Master | Among the best in the sector | Advancement only |
| 8-9 | Legendary | Galaxy-renowned, pushing boundaries | Advancement only |
| 10 | Transcendent | Reality-defying capability | Advancement only |

**Skill Advancement**: Skills above 5 can only be gained through play using Advancement Points (see Chapter 4). This represents the experience and training that comes from actual use rather than initial education.

### Attribute Pairings

Most skills have a primary attribute but can pair with others for specific applications:

**Combat + Might**: Melee attacks, breaking objects
**Combat + Coordination**: Ranged attacks, quick draws
**Combat + Awareness**: Tactical assessment, ambush detection
**Combat + Intellect**: Analyzing fighting styles, planning battles

The GM determines which pairing fits the situation, or players can suggest creative applications.

### Untrained Skill Use

Characters without ranks in a skill (rating 0) can still attempt most tasks:
- Roll 2d10 + Attribute only
- Some specialized tasks require at least 1 rank
- Complex technical tasks may be impossible untrained

- Critical: +3 to primary actor
- Failure: No bonus
- Critical failure: -1 penalty

**Group Efforts**: Multiple characters working together
- Designate primary actor
- Each successful helper adds +1
- Maximum bonus: +5

### Opposed Checks

When characters act against each other:
1. Both roll skill checks
2. Higher result wins
3. Ties go to defender/status quo
4. Margin determines degree

Common opposed checks:
- Stealth vs Awareness
- Deception vs Investigation
- Athletics vs Athletics (chase)
- Social vs Resolve (persuasion)

### Skill Challenges

Complex scenarios requiring multiple skills:

**Example - Infiltrating Secure Facility**:
1. Technology to bypass outer sensors
2. Stealth to avoid guards
3. Athletics to scale walls
4. Deception if caught
5. Investigation to find objective

Success thresholds and consequences vary by approach.

## Skill Synergies

When multiple skills apply, use the most advantageous:

**Primary + Supporting**: Main skill with +1 if supporting skill 3+

**Common Synergies**:
- Investigation + Technology: Digital forensics
- Medicine + Science: Research cures
- Combat + Athletics: Parkour fighting
- Social + Deception: Manipulation
- Pilot + Technology: Ship modifications

- Disadvantage: Use worst two dice

## Optional: Social Combat System

For complex negotiations, debates, or diplomatic encounters, use structured social combat:

**Initiative**: 1d10 + Presence + Awareness
**Social HP**: 20 + (Presence × 4) + (Resolve × 2)
**Social Defense**: 10 + Presence + Resolve

**Social Attacks**:
