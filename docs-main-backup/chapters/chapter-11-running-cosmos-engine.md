# Chapter 11: Running Cosmos Engine

As Game Master (GM), you are the director, narrator, and arbiter of your Cosmos Engine campaign. This chapter provides tools and guidance for running engaging sessions, designing balanced encounters, and creating memorable stories across the scales of science fiction.

## The Game Master's Role

### Core Responsibilities

**World Builder**: Create the setting where adventures occur
- Define locations from local to galactic
- Establish factions and power structures
- Determine technology levels and limitations

### GM Principles

**Say Yes, But...**: When players propose creative solutions
- Encourage innovation with complications
- "Yes, you can hack the door, but it will alert security"
- Build on player ideas rather than blocking them

**Fail Forward**: Make failure interesting
- Failed rolls create new problems, not dead ends

**Play to Find Out**: Don't predetermine outcomes
- Let dice and decisions shape the story
- Be surprised alongside your players
- Adapt plans based on events

## Session Zero and Campaign Setup

### Establishing Expectations

**Campaign Concept**: Define the game's scope
- Genre: Hard SF, space opera, cyberpunk, etc.
- Scale: Personal, planetary, or galactic
- Tone: Gritty realism or heroic adventure
- Technology level and limitations

**Safety Tools**: Ensure comfort for all
- Lines: Topics never to include
- Veils: Topics to handle off-screen
- X-Card: Signal to skip uncomfortable content
- Regular check-ins on boundaries

**Table Rules**: Set social expectations
- Device usage and distractions
- Food and breaks
- Attendance and scheduling
- Note-taking and record keeping

### Character Integration

**Group Cohesion**: Why are they together?
- Shared background or employer
- Common goal or enemy
- Complementary skills and resources
- Interconnected personal stakes

**Individual Hooks**: Connect each character
- Personal goals within campaign arc
- Relationships with NPCs
- Secrets to reveal over time
- Growth opportunities

## Core GM Mechanics

### Setting Difficulty

**Target Number Guidelines**:

| Difficulty | TN | When to Use |
|------------|----|--------------| 
| Trivial | 8 | Routine tasks under pressure |
| Easy | 11 | Basic professional tasks |
| Moderate | 14 | Standard challenges |
| Hard | 17 | Difficult professional tasks |
| Extreme | 20 | Near-impossible feats |
| Legendary | 23 | Heroic achievements |
| Impossible | 26 | Should require special circumstances |

**Adjusting Difficulty**:
- Player approach and preparation
- Available tools and resources
- Time pressure and distractions
- Environmental conditions
- Assistance from others

### Success and Failure

**Degrees of Success**:
- **Marginal (0-2)**: Barely achieved, with complications
- **Solid (3-5)**: Clear success as intended
- **Critical (6-9)**: Exceptional result with benefits
- **Legendary (10+)**: Perfect execution, lasting advantages

**Degrees of Failure**:
- **Marginal (1-2)**: Almost succeeded, minor setback
- **Clear (3-5)**: Definite failure, expected consequences
- **Critical (6-9)**: Serious failure, additional problems
- **Catastrophic (10+)**: Disaster, cascading complications

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Grant advantage (roll 3d10, use best 2) for:
- Superior equipment or positioning
- Effective teamwork
- Creative approaches
- Character specializations

Impose disadvantage (roll 3d10, use worst 2) for:
- Poor conditions or tools
- Distractions or pressure
- Acting outside expertise
- Accumulated fatigue

## Encounter Design

### Combat Encounters (Balanced System)

**Challenge Rating by Level**:

| PC Level | Standard Enemy | Challenging | Deadly |
|----------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| 1-2 | Level 1-2 | Level 3-4 | Level 5+ |
| 3-4 | Level 3-4 | Level 5-6 | Level 7+ |
| 5-6 | Level 5-6 | Level 7-8 | Level 9+ |
| 7-8 | Level 7-8 | Level 9-10 | Level 11+ |
| 9-10 | Level 9-10 | Level 11-12 | Level 13+ |
| 11-12 | Level 11-12 | Level 13-14 | Level 15+ |
| 13-14 | Level 13-14 | Level 15-16 | Level 17+ |
| 15-16 | Level 15-16 | Level 17-18 | Level 19+ |
| 17-18 | Level 17-18 | Level 19-20 | Level 20+ |
| 19-20 | Level 19-20 | Level 20+ | Legendary |

**Level Gap Mechanics**:
- **5-9 levels below PCs**: Minions (reduced stats, group attacks)
- **10+ levels below PCs**: **Mooks** (drop with any successful hit regardless of damage)
- **Equal level**: Standard combatants
- **1-2 levels above**: Elite enemies
- **3-4 levels above**: Boss enemies
- **5+ levels above**: Overwhelming threat

**Mook Rules**: Mooks represent vastly inferior opponents (untrained guards, basic robots, etc.). Any successful attack automatically defeats a mook, regardless of damage rolled. This allows high-level characters to cut through hordes of weak enemies cinematically while still requiring effort and actions.

**Encounter Building**:
1. Determine desired challenge level
2. Select appropriate enemy levels
3. Adjust for party size (+1 enemy per 2 extra PCs)
4. Add environmental factors
5. Consider action economy balance

### Social Encounters

**Influence System**:
- NPCs have Disposition (-5 to +5)
- Social rolls shift Disposition
- Thresholds trigger attitude changes

**Disposition Levels**:
- **Hostile (-5 to -3)**: Actively opposes
- **Unfriendly (-2 to -1)**: Reluctant to help
- **Neutral (0)**: No strong opinion
- **Friendly (+1 to +2)**: Willing to help
- **Allied (+3 to +5)**: Actively supports

**Social Challenge DCs**:
- Simple request: TN 11
- Moderate favor: TN 14
- Major request: TN 17
- Extreme demand: TN 20

### Exploration Encounters

**Discovery Types**:
- **Environmental**: Natural phenomena, hazards
- **Archaeological**: Ruins, artifacts, clues
- **Technological**: Equipment, data, upgrades
- **Social**: New cultures, contacts, information

**Exploration Mechanics**:
- Extended skill challenges
- Resource management
- Time pressure
- Hidden information reveals
