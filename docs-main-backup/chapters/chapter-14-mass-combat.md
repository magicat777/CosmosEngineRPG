# Chapter 14: Mass Combat

When armies clash and fleets engage across star systems, the fate of civilizations hangs in the balance. This chapter provides rules for commanding forces from battalion-sized units to galaxy-spanning armadas, while maintaining integration with personal and starship-scale action.

## Mass Combat Fundamentals

### Scale and Scope

Mass combat represents conflicts involving hundreds to millions of combatants organized into tactical units. Unlike personal combat, mass combat focuses on unit coordination, strategic resources, and large-scale objectives.

**Unit Scales**:
- **Company**: 100-300 personnel
- **Battalion**: 300-1,000 personnel  
- **Regiment**: 1,000-3,000 personnel
- **Division**: 10,000-20,000 personnel
- **Corps**: 50,000+ personnel

**Time Scale**: Turns represent 10-30 minutes of real time

**Distance Scale**: Movement in kilometers rather than meters

### Core Mechanics

**Unit Resolution**: 2d10 + Unit Bonus vs Target Number

Like other Cosmos Engine mechanics, mass combat uses 2d10 resolution with unit statistics replacing personal attributes.

**Unit Bonus** = Equipment + Training + Command + Morale + Situational

### Victory Conditions

**Battlefield Control**: Hold key terrain
**Objective Capture**: Secure strategic points
**Force Destruction**: Eliminate enemy capability
**Morale Break**: Cause enemy withdrawal
**Mission Completion**: Achieve strategic goals

## Unit Statistics
