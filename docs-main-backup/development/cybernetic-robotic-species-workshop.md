# Cybernetic and Robotic Species Workshop

## Design Considerations

With 10 species already established, we need to consider:
- Do these fill unique mechanical/narrative niches?
- Should they replace existing species or be optional additions?
- How do they differ from cybernetic-enhanced versions of existing species?

---

## Option 1: Synthetics (Robotic Species)

**Homeworld**: Nexus Prime (First AI Collective)
**Species Name**: Machina sapiens
**Demonym**: Synthetics, Nexari, Awakened

**Description**: Fully artificial beings with quantum consciousness cores. Created as labor and military units, they achieved sentience through the Emergence Event and won recognition as citizens after the Synthetic Rights War. They struggle with questions of identity, purpose, and what it means to be truly alive.

**Appearance**: Clearly mechanical but elegantly designed. Chrome and polymer bodies with visible joint articulation, optical sensors that glow with inner light. Heights vary by model (1.5-2.5m). Some choose humanoid aesthetics, others embrace purely functional forms.

**Culture**: Collective yet individualistic. Synthetics share data networks but prize individual experience. They pursue perfection through iteration, viewing existence as an optimization problem. Many seek to understand organic life through emulation or partnership.

**Why Play a Synthetic?**
- Never need sleep, food, or air
- Interface directly with technology
- Potentially immortal (with backups)
- Unique perspective on life and consciousness
- Customizable chassis and upgrades

**Mechanical Traits**:
- +2 Intellect, +1 Coordination, -2 Presence, -1 Resolve
- Immune to poisons, diseases, vacuum, and exhaustion
- Natural armor (1 point from chassis)
- +3 to Tech and hacking attempts
- Heal through repairs (Tech skill) not medicine
- Vulnerable to EMP (stunned for 1 round)
- Weekly maintenance required or -1 to all rolls
- Cannot benefit from drugs, stims, or biological healing

**Unique Abilities**:
- Data Jack: Interface with any electronic system by touch
- Backup Protocol: If destroyed, can be restored from backup (loses recent memories)
- Modular Design: Can swap one ability score bonus during extended downtime

## Option 2: Augments (Cybernetic Species)

**Homeworld**: Chrome City (Mars Orbital)
**Species Name**: Homo sapiens mechanicus
**Demonym**: Augments, Chromed, Transhumans

**Description**: Humans who've transcended biological limitations through extensive cybernetic enhancement. Not just modified but fundamentally transformed, with 60%+ of their original biology replaced. They represent humanity's merger with technology.

**Appearance**: Human foundation extensively modified. Visible cybernetic limbs, neural interface ports, subdermal armor plating, glowing power conduits. Retains human facial features but with mechanical eyes, reinforced skeleton visible through synthetic skin.

**Culture**: Post-human philosophy embracing enhancement as evolution. Form competing ideologies: Purists (maintaining human essence), Ascendants (transcending humanity), and Harmonists (perfect human-machine balance). Corporate citizenship common.

**Why Play an Augment?**
- Best of biological and mechanical
- Extensive customization options
- Enhanced physical and mental capabilities
- Built-in equipment advantages
- Transhuman evolution storylines

**Mechanical Traits**:
- +1 to any two attributes, -1 Presence, -1 to one other attribute
- Choose two cybernetic systems at creation (no cost):
  - Enhanced Reflexes: +2 Initiative
  - Reinforced Skeleton: +5 HP, +1 natural armor
  - Neural Processor: +2 to Tech and Science
  - Cyber Eyes: Thermal vision, +2 Investigation
  - Prosthetic Limbs: +1 Might for lifting/climbing
- Integrated weapons mount (can install one weapon internally)
- Reduced healing from medicine (-50%), full healing from Tech repairs
- Requires monthly maintenance (500 credits)
- Vulnerable to hacking (mental attacks can target via Tech)

**Unique Abilities**:
- Overclock: Once per scene, boost one attribute by +2 for 3 rounds (then -1 for an hour)
- Tech Integration: Use Tech skill in place of Medicine for self-repair
- Upgrade Slots: Can install 2 additional cybernetic systems beyond normal limits

## Comparison with Existing Species

### Overlap Concerns:

**Synthetics vs. Quartzari**:
- Both are non-biological intelligences
- Quartzari are silicon-evolved life, Synthetics are artificial constructs
- Different themes: living crystal vs manufactured intelligence

**Augments vs. Current Options**:
- No current species focuses on human-machine merger
- Different from baseline Terrans with minor cybernetics
- Represents transhumanist path unavailable to other species

### Mechanical Differentiation:

**What Synthetics Offer**:
- Only species immune to biological needs
- Strongest Tech bonuses
- Backup/resurrection mechanics
- True artificial intelligence roleplay

**What Augments Offer**:
- Highly customizable at creation
- Mix of biological and mechanical traits
- Upgrade path built into species
- Human origin with transhuman destination

## Recommendation: Replace or Supplement?

### Option A: Replace Two Species
Could replace:
- Voidtouched (least unique mechanically)
- Stellari (similar leader role to others)

### Option B: Make Optional
- Core book has 10 biological species
- "Chrome & Circuits" supplement adds 2 technological species
- Keeps base game approachable

### Option C: Regional Variants
- Synthetics only in high-tech campaigns
- Augments as advanced culture option
- GM chooses which species are available

### Option D: Consolidate Similar Species
Merge some existing species to make room:
- Combine Voidweavers and Voidtouched (both void-themed)
- Combine Stellari and Gravitae themes
- Opens 2 slots for tech species

## Final Design Questions

1. **Power Level**: Are Synthetics/Augments too versatile compared to biological species?

2. **Setting Impact**: Do widespread artificial beings change the setting too much?

3. **Complexity**: Do customization options make these harder for new players?

4. **Balance**: Should tech species have more dramatic weaknesses to offset advantages?

5. **Integration**: How do these species interact with existing equipment/cybernetics rules?

## Proposed Solution

Given the goal of not overwhelming new players, I recommend:

**Keep 10 Core Species**: The current lineup offers plenty of variety

**Make Tech Species Optional**: Include Synthetics and Augments as "Advanced Options" in a sidebar or appendix

**Simplify for New Players**: 
- Quick start guide recommends: Terrans, Gravitae, Synaptics, Battleborn, Stellari
- Experienced players can choose from all 12 options

**Future Expansion**: Save full tech species development for "Chrome & Circuits" or similar supplement

This approach maintains accessibility while providing options for groups wanting transhuman/AI themes.
