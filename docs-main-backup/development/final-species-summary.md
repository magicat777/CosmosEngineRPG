## Species Diversity Analysis

### By Origin Type:
- **Pure Biological**: 6 (Terrans, Gravitae, Synaptics, Battleborn, Stellari, Gravborn)
- **Technological**: 2 (Synthetics, Augments)
- **Exotic Biology**: 2 (Verdathi, Quartzari)

### By Primary Role:
- **Generalists**: 1 (Terrans)
- **Warriors**: 2 (Battleborn, Gravborn)
- **Technicians**: 3 (Synthetics, Gravitae, Synaptics)
- **Leaders**: 1 (Stellari)
- **Specialists**: 3 (Augments, Verdathi, Quartzari)

### By Attribute Focus:
- **Might**: Battleborn, Gravborn
- **Coordination**: Synaptics, Synthetics
- **Awareness**: Verdathi
- **Intellect**: Synthetics, Quartzari
- **Resolve**: Gravitae, Stellari
- **Presence**: Stellari
- **Flexible**: Terrans, Augments

## Why This Lineup Works

### 1. **Clear Differentiation**
Each species has a distinct mechanical and narrative niche. No two species fill the same role.

### 2. **Technological Spectrum**
From pure biological (Verdathi) to pure artificial (Synthetics), with everything in between.

### 3. **Size Variety**
From tiny Synaptics (1m) to towering Gravborn (3m), accommodating different playstyles.

### 4. **Cultural Diversity**
Warrior cultures, peaceful philosophers, collective minds, and individualists all represented.

### 5. **Mechanical Balance**
Each species totals +2/-2 in attributes (except flexible Augments), maintaining balance.

### 6. **Story Potential**
Every species has built-in narrative hooks and cultural conflicts to explore.

## Removed Species Rationale

**Voidweavers** and **Voidtouched** were removed because:
- Both had "void" themes creating redundancy
- Voidweavers overlapped with Quartzari as exotic thinkers
- Voidtouched's stealth role is partially covered by small Synaptics
- Their removal made room for more unique technological species

## Implementation Notes

### For New Players:
Recommend starting with:
- **Terrans** (no special rules)
- **Gravitae** (straightforward tough guy)
- **Synaptics** (simple speed boost)
- **Battleborn** (classic warrior)
- **Stellari** (social character)

### For Experienced Players:
More complex options:
- **Synthetics** (different healing, no biological needs)
- **Augments** (customization choices)
- **Verdathi** (unique biology)
- **Quartzari** (silicon-based exceptions)
- **Gravborn** (size considerations)

## Future Expansion Potential

This lineup leaves room for future supplements to add:
- Psionic species
- Energy beings  
- Shapeshifters
- Hive minds
- Time-displaced species

Without overwhelming the core game with too many initial choices.
