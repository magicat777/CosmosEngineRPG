# Armor & Defensive Systems Catalog

## Overview

Defensive systems in Cosmos Engine provide protection through three distinct mechanisms: Passive Defense (physical armor), Active Defense (shields and countermeasures), and Electronic Defense (digital protection). Each system has strengths, weaknesses, and specific counters, creating tactical depth without overwhelming complexity.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Three defense types prevent single-solution dominance
- Technology eras unlock new options rather than just bigger numbers
- Meaningful tradeoffs between protection, mobility, and cost
- Environmental protection scales with combat protection
- Stealth vs protection creates strategic choices

**Defense Rating**: +0 to +3 (balanced scaling by technology era)  
**Maximum Total Defense**: +3 (prevents number inflation)  
**Scale Integration**: Personal â†’ Capital ship armor
**Balance Note**: Defense bonuses capped at +3 to maintain tactical balance
