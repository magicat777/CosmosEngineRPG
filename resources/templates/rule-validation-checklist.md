**System/Subsystem**: _______________________

## Core Compliance (Must Pass All)

### üé≤ Dice Mechanics
- [ ] Uses 2d10 for resolution
- [ ] No other dice types for core resolution
- [ ] Preserves bell curve (mean 11.0)
- [ ] Natural 20 = auto-success + bonus
- [ ] Natural 2 = auto-fail + complication

### üìä Modifier Structure  
- [ ] Uses only 4 modifier categories (Attribute, Skill, Equipment, Situation)
- [ ] Total modifiers cannot exceed +8
- [ ] Total penalties cannot exceed -6
- [ ] Each component within defined ranges

### üéØ Target Numbers
- [ ] All TNs between 8-20
- [ ] Uses standard difficulty scale (8/11/14/17/20)
- [ ] No auto-success outside Natural 20
- [ ] No auto-fail outside Natural 2

## Design Alignment

### üèóÔ∏è Complexity Budget
Target complexity for this system: ___/10

- [ ] Rule complexity matches target
- [ ] Tracking requirements minimal
- [ ] Can be learned in one explanation
- [ ] Examples make it clear

### ‚öñÔ∏è Design Principles
- [ ] Favors specialization over generalization
- [ ] Uses binary choices over graduated tracking
- [ ] Technology integration feels sci-fi
- [ ] Works across all 4 scales
- [ ] Maintains tactical depth

### üîÑ Integration
- [ ] Compatible with existing subsystems
- [ ] Uses consistent terminology
- [ ] No exception-based rules
- [ ] Clear interaction points

## Scale Compatibility

Test at each scale:
- [ ] **Personal**: Works for individual characters
- [ ] **Vehicle**: Applies to vehicles/mechs
- [ ] **Starship**: Functions for space combat
- [ ] **Capital**: Scales to fleet operations

Note any scale-specific modifications: _______________________

## Probability Analysis

### Quick Math Check
Example scenario with typical modifiers (+6):
- Easy (TN 8): ___% success (should be ~85%)
- Moderate (TN 11): ___% success (should be ~65%)
- Hard (TN 14): ___% success (should be ~35%)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Minimum modifiers still playable
- [ ] Maximum modifiers don't break system
- [ ] Critical results properly defined

## Playtesting Requirements

### Before Approval
- [ ] Written examples provided
- [ ] Math validated
- [ ] At least one mock scenario run
- [ ] Potential exploits considered

### After Implementation  
- [ ] Playtest in isolation
- [ ] Playtest with full system
- [ ] Gather player feedback
- [ ] Monitor for complexity creep

## Documentation Needs

- [ ] Rule clearly written
- [ ] Examples for common cases
- [ ] Edge cases addressed
- [ ] Integration points noted
- [ ] Version history updated
