## Adaptation Notes

This build demonstrates how Cosmos Engine can handle Force users by:
1. Using **Psionics** as a specialist skill
2. Applying **tags** to differentiate traditions (Dathomiri vs Jedi vs Sith)
3. **Cross-skill synergies** creating unique Force applications
4. **Scale mechanics** working for individual powers up to fleet command
5. **Technology Era** affecting Force artifact availability

The same Psionics skill could build completely different Force users based on tag combinations and supporting skills!
