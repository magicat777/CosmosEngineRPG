## Adaptation Notes

This build demonstrates how Psionics can represent:
1. **Artificial precognition** through algorithmic prediction
2. **Non-mystical "mental powers"** via quantum processing
3. **Cross-skill synergies** between Tech and Psionics
4. **AI consciousness** within existing skill framework
5. **Technological transcendence** through tag combinations

The same framework could build other AI characters: military tactical AIs, economic modeling AIs, or social manipulation AIs, each with different supporting skills and tag focuses.
