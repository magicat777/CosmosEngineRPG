## Adaptation Notes

This build demonstrates how expanded Psionics can handle:
1. **Prescient abilities** through [Prophetic] and [Temporal] tags
2. **Mental enhancement** via Mentat training
3. **Cross-skill synergies** between Psionics, Command, and Investigation
4. **Scale mechanics** working from personal insight to galactic prophecy

The same Psionics skill could build completely different precognitive characters based on tradition (Bene Gesserit vs Guild Navigator vs Atreides) and supporting skills!
