## Adaptation Notes

This build demonstrates how Psionics can handle:
1. **Dark side Force powers** through [Lethal] and [Mysterious] tags
2. **Mental domination** via [Social] cross-skill synergies
3. **Political manipulation** through Social and Command integration
4. **Sith philosophy** expressed through tag manifestations
5. **Scale progression** from personal influence to galactic empire

The same framework could build other Force users: Jedi Masters (different tag focus), Gray Jedi (balanced approach), or Force-sensitive non-Jedi (limited Psionics investment).
